# 3 Finding the biggest time consumers

 
Integer overflow is another security problem. The official C standard says that the behavior 
of signed integers in case of overflow is "undefined". This allows the compiler to ignore 
overflow or assume that it doesn't occur. In the case of the Gnu compiler, the assumption 
that signed integer overflow doesn't occur has the unfortunate consequence that it allows 
the compiler to optimize away an overflow check. There are a number of possible remedies 
against this problem: (1) check for overflow before it occurs, (2) use unsigned integers - 
they are guaranteed to wrap around, (3) trap integer overflow with the option -ftrapv, but 
this is extremely inefficient, (4) get a compiler warning for such optimizations with option 
-Wstrict-overflow=2, or (5) make the overflow behavior well-defined with option 
-fwrapv or -fno-strict-overflow. 
 
You may deviate from the above security advices in critical parts of the code where speed is 
important. This can be permissible if the unsafe code is limited to well-tested functions, 
classes, templates or modules with a well-defined interface to the rest of the program. 
 
 
3 Finding the biggest time consumers 
3.1 How much is a clock cycle? 
In this manual, I am using CPU clock cycles rather than seconds or microseconds as a time 
measure. This is because computers have very different speeds. If I write that something 
takes 10 μs today, then it may take only 5 μs on the next generation of computers and my 
manual will soon be obsolete. But if I write that something takes 10 clock cycles then it will 
still take 10 clock cycles even if the CPU clock frequency is doubled. 
 
The length of a clock cycle is the reciprocal of the clock frequency. For example, if the clock 
frequency is 2 GHz then the length of a clock cycle is 
ns.
5.0
GHz

 
 
A clock cycle on one computer is not always comparable to a clock cycle on another 
computer. The Pentium 4 (NetBurst) CPU is designed for a higher clock frequency than 
other CPUs, but it uses more clock cycles than other CPUs for executing the same piece of 
code in general.  
 
Assume that a loop in a program repeats 1000 times and that there are 100 floating point 
operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) inside the loop. If each floating point operation 
takes 5 clock cycles, then we can roughly estimate that the loop will take 1000 * 100 * 5 * 
0.5 ns = 250 μs on a 2 GHz CPU. Should we try to optimize this loop? Certainly not! 250 μs 
is less than 1/50 of the time it takes to refresh the screen. There is no way the user can see 
the delay. But if the loop is inside another loop that also repeats 1000 times then we have 
an estimated calculation time of 250 ms. This delay is just long enough to be noticeable but 
not long enough to be annoying. We may decide to do some measurements to see if our 
estimate is correct or if the calculation time is actually more than 250 ms. If the response 
time is so long that the user actually has to wait for a result then we will consider if there is 
something that can be improved. 
 
3.2 Use a profiler to find hot spots 
Before you start to optimize anything, you have to identify the critical parts of the program. 
In some programs, more than 99% of the time is spent in the innermost loop doing 
mathematical calculations. In other programs, 99% of the time is spent on reading and 
writing data files while less than 1% goes to actually doing something on these data. It is 
very important to optimize the parts of the code that matters rather than the parts of the 
code that use only a small fraction of the total time. Optimizing less critical parts of the code 


---

 
will not only be a waste of time, it also makes the code less clear and more difficult to debug 
and maintain. 
 
Most compiler packages include a profiler that can tell how many times each function is 
called and how much time it uses. There are also third-party profilers such as AQtime, Intel 
VTune and AMD CodeAnalyst. 
 
There are several different profiling methods: 
 
 
Instrumentation: The compiler inserts extra code at each function call to count how 
many times the function is called and how much time it takes. 
 
 
Debugging. The profiler inserts temporary debug breakpoints at every function or every 
code line. 
   
 
Time-based sampling: The profiler tells the operating system to generate an interrupt, 
e.g. every millisecond. The profiler counts how many times an interrupt occurs in each 
part of the program. This requires no modification of the program under test, but is less 
reliable. 
 
 
Event-based sampling: The profiler tells the CPU to generate interrupts at certain 
events, for example every time a thousand cache misses have occurred. This makes it 
possible to see which part of the program has most cache misses, branch 
mispredictions, floating point exceptions, etc. Event-based sampling requires a CPU-
specific profiler. For Intel CPUs use Intel VTune, for AMD CPUs use AMD CodeAnalyst. 
 
Unfortunately, profilers are often unreliable. They sometimes give misleading results or fail 
completely because of technical problems. 
 
Some common problems with profilers are: 
 
 
Coarse time measurement. If time is measured with millisecond resolution and the 
critical functions take microseconds to execute then measurements can become 
imprecise or simply zero. 
 
 
Execution time too small or too long. If the program under test finishes in a short time 
then the sampling generates too little data for analysis. If the program takes too long 
time to execute then the profiler may sample more data than it can handle. 
 
 
Waiting for user input. Many programs spend most of their time waiting for user input or 
network resources. This time is included in the profile. It may be necessary to modify the 
program to use a set of test data instead of user input in order to make profiling feasible. 
 
 
Interference from other processes. The profiler measures not only the time spent in the 
program under test but also the time used by all other processes running on the same 
computer, including the profiler itself. 
 
 
Function addresses are obscured in optimized programs. The profiler identifies any hot 
spots in the program by their address and attempts to translate these addresses to 
function names. But a highly optimized program is often reorganized in such a way that 
there is no clear correspondence between function names and code addresses. The 
names of inlined functions may not be visible at all to the profiler. The result will be 
misleading reports of which functions take most time. 
   
 
Uses debug version of the code. Some profilers require that the code you are testing 
contains debug information in order to identify individual functions or code lines. The 


---

 
debug version of the code is not optimized. 
   
 
Jumps between CPU cores. A process or thread does not necessarily stay in the same 
processor core on multi-core CPUs, but event-counters do. This results in meaningless 
event counts for threads that jump between multiple CPU cores. You may need to lock a 
thread to a specific CPU core by setting a thread affinity mask. 
   
 
Poor reproducibility. Delays in program execution may be caused by random events that 
are not reproducible. Such events as task switches and garbage collection can occur at 
random times and make parts of the program appear to take longer time than normally. 
 
There are various alternatives to using a profiler. A simple alternative is to run the program 
in a debugger and press break while the program is running. If there is a hot spot that uses 
90% of the CPU time then there is a 90% chance that the break will occur in this hot spot. 
Repeating the break a few times may be enough to identify a hot spot. Use the call stack in 
the debugger to identify the circumstances around the hot spot. 
 
Sometimes, the best way to identify performance bottlenecks is to put measurement 
instruments directly into the code rather than using a ready-made profiler. This does not 
solve all the problems associated with profiling, but it often gives more reliable results. If you 
are not satisfied with the way a profiler works then you may put the desired measurement 
instruments into the program itself. You may add counter variables that count how many 
times each part of the program is executed. Furthermore, you may read the time before and 
after each of the most important or critical parts of the program to measure how much time 
each part takes. See page 157 for further discussion of this method. 
 
Your measurement code should have #if directives around it so that it can be disabled in 
the final version of the code. Inserting your own profiling instruments in the code itself is a 
very useful way to keep track of the performance during the development of a program. 
 
The time measurements may require a very high resolution if time intervals are short. In 
Windows, you can use the GetTickCount or QueryPerformanceCounter functions for 
millisecond resolution. A much higher resolution can be obtained with the time stamp 
counter in the CPU, which counts at the CPU clock frequency (in Windows: __rdtsc()). 
 
The time stamp counter becomes invalid if a thread jumps between different CPU cores. 
You may have to fix the thread to a specific CPU core during time measurements to avoid 
this. (In Windows, SetThreadAffinityMask, in Linux, sched_setaffinity). 
 
The program should be tested with a realistic set of test data. The test data should contain a 
typical degree of randomness in order to get a realistic number of cache misses and branch 
mispredictions. 
 
When the most time-consuming parts of the program have been found, then it is important 
to focus the optimization efforts on the time consuming parts only. Critical pieces of code 
can be further tested and investigated by the methods described on page 157. 
 
A profiler is most useful for finding problems that relate to CPU-intensive code. But many 
programs use more time loading files or accessing databases, network and other resources 
than doing arithmetic operations. The most common time-consumers are discussed in the 
following sections. 
 
3.3 Program installation 
The time it takes to install a program package is not traditionally considered a software 
optimization issue. But it is certainly something that can steal the user's time. The time it 
takes to install a software package and make it work cannot be ignored if the goal of 


---

 
software optimization is to save time for the user. With the high complexity of modern 
software, it is not unusual for the installation process to take more than an hour. Neither is it 
unusual that a user has to reinstall a software package several times in order to find and 
resolve compatibility problems. 
 
Software developers should take installation time and compatibility problems into account 
when deciding whether to base a software package on a complex framework requiring 
many files to be installed. 
 
The installation process should always use standardized installation tools. It should be 
possible to select all installation options at the start so that the rest of the installation 
process can proceed unattended. Uninstallation should also proceed in a standardized 
manner. 
 
3.4 Automatic updates 
Many software programs automatically download updates through the Internet at regular 
time intervals. Some programs search for updates every time the computer starts up, even if 
the program is never used. A computer with many such programs installed can take several 
minutes to start up, which is a total waste of the user's time. Other programs use time 
searching for updates each time the program starts. The user may not need the updates if 
the current version satisfies the user's needs. The search for updates should be optional 
and off by default unless there is a compelling security reason for updating. The update 
process should run in a low priority thread, and only if the program is actually used. No 
program should leave a background process running when it is not in use. The installation 
of downloaded program updates should be postponed until the program is shut down and 
restarted anyway. 
 
Updates to the operating system can be particularly time consuming. Sometimes it takes 
hours to install automatic updates to the operating system. This is very problematic because 
these time consuming updates may come unpredictably at inconvenient times. This can be 
a very big problem if the user has to turn off or log off the computer for security reasons 
before leaving their workplace and the system forbids the user to turn off the computer 
during the update process. 
 
3.5 Program loading 
Often, it takes more time to load a program than to execute it. The load time can be 
annoyingly high for programs that are based on big runtime frameworks, intermediate code, 
interpreters, just-in-time compilers, etc., as is commonly the case with programs written in 
Java, C#, Visual Basic, etc. 
 
But program loading can be a time-consumer even for programs implemented in compiled 
C++. This typically happens if the program uses a lot of runtime DLL's (dynamically linked 
libraries or shared objects), resource files, configuration files, help files and databases. The 
operating system may not load all the modules of a big program when the program starts 
up. Some modules may be loaded only when they are needed, or they may be swapped to 
the hard disk if the RAM size is insufficient. 
 
The user expects immediate responses to simple actions like a key press or mouse move. It 
is unacceptable to the user if such a response is delayed for several seconds because it 
requires the loading of modules or resource files from disk. Memory-hungry applications 
force the operating system to swap memory to disk. Memory swapping is a frequent cause 
of unacceptably long response times to simple things like a mouse move or key press. 
 


---

 
Avoid an excessive number of DLLs, configuration files, resource files, help files etc. 
scattered around on the hard disk. A few files, preferably in the same directory as the .exe 
file, is acceptable. 
 
3.6 Dynamic linking and position-independent code 
Function libraries can be implemented either as static link libraries (*.lib, *.a) or dynamic 
link libraries, also called shared objects (*.dll, *.so). There are several factors that can 
make dynamic link libraries slower than static link libraries. These factors are explained in 
detail on page 149 below. 
 
Position-independent code is used in shared objects in Unix-like systems. Mac systems 
often use position-independent code everywhere by default. Position-independent code is 
inefficient, especially in 32-bit mode, for reasons explained on page 149 below. 
 
3.7 File access 
Reading or writing a file on a hard disk often takes much more time than processing the 
data in the file, especially if the user has a virus scanner that scans all files on access. 
 
Sequential forward access to a file is faster than random access. Reading or writing big 
blocks is faster than reading or writing a small bit at a time. Do not read or write less than a 
few kilobytes at a time. 
 
You may mirror the entire file in a memory buffer and read or write it in one operation rather 
than reading or writing small bits in a non-sequential manner. 
 
It is usually much faster to access a file that has been accessed recently than to access it 
the first time. This is because the file has been copied to the disk cache. 
 
Files on remote or removable media such as floppy disks and USB sticks may not be 
cached. This can have quite dramatic consequences. I once made a Windows program that 
created a file by calling WritePrivateProfileString, which opens and closes the file 
for each line written. This worked sufficiently fast on a hard disk because of disk caching, 
but it took several minutes to write the file to a floppy disk. 
 
A big file containing numerical data is more compact and efficient if the data are stored in 
binary form than if the data are stored in ASCII form. A disadvantage of binary data storage 
is that it is not human readable and not easily ported to systems with big-endian storage. 
 
Optimizing file access is more important than optimizing CPU use in programs that have 
many file input/output operations. It can be advantageous to put file access in a separate 
thread if there is other work that the processor can do while waiting for disk operations to 
finish. 
 
3.8 System database 
It can take several seconds to access the system database in Windows. It is more efficient 
to store application-specific information in a separate file than in the big registration 
database in the Windows system. Note that the system may store the information in the 
database anyway if you are using functions such as GetPrivateProfileString and 
WritePrivateProfileString to read and write configuration files (*.ini files). 
 


---

 
3.9 Other databases 
Many software applications use a database for storing user data. A database can consume 
a lot of CPU time, RAM and disk space. It may be possible to replace a database by a plain 
old data file in simple cases. Database queries can often be optimized by using indexes, 
working with sets rather than loops, etc. Optimizing database queries is beyond the scope 
of this manual, but you should be aware that there is often a lot to gain by optimizing 
database access. 
 
3.10 Graphics 
A graphical user interface can use a lot of computing resources. Typically, a specific 
graphics framework is used. The operating system may supply such a framework in its API. 
In some cases, there is an extra layer of a third-party graphics framework between the 
operating system API and the application software. Such an extra framework can consume 
a lot of extra resources. 
 
Each graphics operation in the application software is implemented as a function call to a 
graphics library or API function which then calls a device driver. A call to a graphics function 
is time consuming because it may go through multiple layers and it needs to switch to 
protected mode and back again. Obviously, it is more efficient to make a single call to a 
graphics function that draws a whole polygon or bitmap than to draw each pixel or line 
separately through multiple function calls. 
 
The calculation of graphics objects in computer games and animations is of course also 
time consuming, especially if there is no graphics processing unit. 
 
Various graphics function libraries and drivers differ a lot in performance. I have no specific 
recommendation of which one is best. 
 
3.11 Other system resources 
Writes to a printer or other device should preferably be done in big blocks rather than a 
small piece at a time because each call to a driver involves the overhead of switching to 
protected mode and back again. 
 
Accessing system devices and using advanced facilities of the operating system can be 
time consuming because it may involve the loading of several drivers, configuration files and 
system modules. 
 
3.12 Network access 
Some application programs use internet or intranet for automatic updates, remote help files, 
data base access, etc. The problem here is that access times cannot be controlled. The 
network access may be fast in a simple test setup but slow or completely absent in a use 
situation where the network is overloaded or the user is far from the server. 
 
These problems should be taken into account when deciding whether to store help files and 
other resources locally or remotely. If frequent updates are necessary then it may be 
optimal to mirror the remote data locally. 
 
Access to remote databases usually requires log on with a password. The log on process is 
known to be an annoying time consumer to many hard working software users. In some 
cases, the log on process may take more than a minute if the network or database is heavily 
loaded. 
 


---

 
3.13 Memory access 
Accessing data from RAM memory can take quite a long time compared to the time it takes 
to do calculations on the data. This is the reason why all modern computers have memory 
caches. Typically, there is a level-1 data cache of 8 - 64 Kbytes and a level-2 cache of 256 
Kbytes to 2 Mbytes. There may also be a level-3 cache. 
 
If the combined size of all data in a program is bigger than the level-2 cache and the data 
are scattered around in memory or accessed in a non-sequential manner then it is likely that 
memory access is the biggest time-consumer in the program. Reading or writing to a 
variable in memory takes only 2-3 clock cycles if it is cached, but several hundred clock 
cycles if it is not cached. See page 26 about data storage and page 88 about memory 
caching. 
 
3.14 Context switches 
A context switch is a switch between different tasks in a multitasking environment, between 
different threads in a multithreaded program, or between different parts of a big program. 
Frequent context switches can reduce the performance because the contents of data cache, 
code cache, branch target buffer, branch pattern history, etc. may have to be renewed. 
 
Context switches are more frequent if the time slices allocated to each task or thread are 
smaller. The lengths of the time slices is determined by the operating system, not by the 
application program. 
 
The number of context switches is smaller in a computer with multiple CPUs or a CPU with 
multiple cores. 
  
3.15 Dependency chains 
Modern microprocessors can do out-of-order execution. This means that if a piece of 
software specifies the calculation of A and then B, and the calculation of A is slow, then the 
microprocessor can begin the calculation of B before the calculation of A is finished. 
Obviously, this is only possible if the value of A is not needed for the calculation of B. 
 
In order to take advantage of out-of-order execution, you have to avoid long dependency 
chains. A dependency chain is a series of calculations, where each calculation depends on 
the result of the preceding one. This prevents the CPU from doing multiple calculations 
simultaneously or out of order. See page 105 for examples of how to break a dependency 
chain. 
 
3.16 Execution unit throughput 
There is an important distinction between the latency and the throughput of an execution 
unit. For example, it may take 3 - 5 clock cycles to do a floating point addition on a modern 
CPU. But it is possible to start a new floating point addition every clock cycle. This means 
that if each addition depends on the result of the preceding addition then you will have only 
one addition every three clock cycles. But if all the additions are independent then you can 
have one addition every clock cycle. 
 
The highest performance that can possibly be obtained in a computationally intensive 
program is achieved when none of the time-consumers mentioned in the above sections are 
dominating and there are no long dependency chains. In this case, the performance is 
limited by the throughput of the execution units rather than by the latency or by memory 
access. 
 
The execution core of modern microprocessors is split between several execution units. 
Typically, there are two or more integer units, one or two floating point addition units, and
