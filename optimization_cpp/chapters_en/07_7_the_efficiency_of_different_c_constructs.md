# 7 The efficiency of different C++ constructs

 
Since most development methods are incremental or iterative in nature, it is important to 
have a strategy for saving a backup copy of every intermediate version. For one-man 
projects, it is sufficient to make a zip file of every version. For team projects, it is 
recommended to use a version control tool. 
 
 
7 The efficiency of different C++ constructs 
Most programmers have little or no idea how a piece of program code is translated into 
machine code and how the microprocessor handles this code. For example, many 
programmers do not know that double precision calculations are just as fast as single 
precision. And who would know that a template class is more efficient than a polymorphous 
class? 
 
This chapter is aiming at explaining the relative efficiency of different C++ language 
elements in order to help the programmer choosing the most efficient alternative. The 
theoretical background is further explained in the other volumes in this series of manuals. 
 
7.1 Different kinds of variable storage 
Variables and objects are stored in different parts of the memory, depending on how they 
are declared in a C++ program. This has influence on the efficiency of the data cache (see 
page 88). Data caching is poor if data are scattered randomly around in the memory. It is 
therefore important to understand how variables are stored. The storage principles are the 
same for simple variables, arrays and objects. 
Storage on the stack 
Variables and objects declared inside a function are stored on the stack, except for the 
cases described in the sections below. 
 
The stack is a part of memory that is organized in a first-in-last-out fashion. It is used for 
storing function return addresses (i.e. where the function was called from), function 
parameters, local variables, and for saving registers that have to be restored before the 
function returns. Every time a function is called, it allocates the required amount of space on 
the stack for all these purposes. This memory space is freed when the function returns. The 
next time a function is called, it can use the same space for the parameters of the new 
function. 
 
The stack is the most efficient memory space to store data because the same range of 
memory addresses is reused again and again. If there are no big arrays, then it is almost 
certain that this part of the memory is mirrored in the level-1 data cache, where it is 
accessed quite fast. 
 
The lesson we can learn from this is that all variables and objects should preferably be 
declared inside the function in which they are used. 
 
It is possible to make the scope of a variable even smaller by declaring it inside {} brackets. 
However, most compilers do not free the memory used by a variable until the function 
returns even though it could free the memory when exiting the {} brackets in which the 
variable is declared. If the variable is stored in a register (see below) then it may be freed 
before the function returns. 
Global or static storage 
Variables that are declared outside of any function are called global variables. They can be 
accessed from any function. Global variables are stored in a static part of the memory. The 
static memory is also used for variables declared with the static keyword, for floating 


---

 
point constants, string constants, array initializer lists, switch statement jump tables, and 
virtual function tables. 
 
The static data area is usually divided into three parts: one for constants that are never 
modified by the program, one for initialized variables that may be modified by the program, 
and one for uninitialized variables that may be modified by the program. 
 
The advantage of static data is that it can be initialized to desired values before the program 
starts. The disadvantage is that the memory space is occupied throughout the whole 
program execution, even if the variable is only used in a small part of the program. This 
makes data caching less efficient. 
 
Do not make variables global if you can avoid it. Global variables may be needed for 
communication between different threads, but that's about the only situation where they are 
unavoidable. It may be useful to make a variable global if it is accessed by several different 
functions and you want to avoid the overhead of transferring the variable as function 
parameter. But it may be a better solution to make the functions that access the saved 
variable members of the same class and store the shared variable inside the class. Which 
solution you prefer is a matter of programming style. 
 
It is often preferable to make a lookup-table static. Example: 
 
// Example 7.1 
float SomeFunction (int x) { 
   static float list[] = {1.1, 0.3, -2.0, 4.4, 2.5}; 
   return list[x]; 
} 
 
The advantage of using static here is that the list does not need to be initialized when the 
function is called. The values are simply put there when the program is loaded into memory. 
If the word static is removed from the above example, then all five values have to be put 
into the list every time the function is called. This is done by copying the entire list from 
static memory to stack memory. Copying constant data from static memory to the stack is a 
waste of time in most cases, but it may be optimal in special cases where the data are used 
many times in a loop where almost the entire level-1 cache is used in a number of arrays 
that you want to keep together on the stack. 
 
String constants and floating point constants are stored in static memory in optimized code. 
Example: 
 
// Example 7.2 
a = b * 3.5; 
c = d + 3.5; 
 
Here, the constant 3.5 will be stored in static memory. Most compilers will recognize that 
the two constants are identical so that only one constant needs to be stored. All identical 
constants in the entire program will be joined together in order to minimize the amount of 
cache space used for constants. 
 
Integer constants are usually included as part of the instruction code. You can assume that 
there are no caching problems for integer constants. 
Register storage 
A limited number of variables can be stored in registers instead of main memory. A register 
is a small piece of memory inside the CPU used for temporary storage. Variables that are 
stored in registers are accessed very fast. All optimizing compilers will automatically choose 
the most often used variables in a function for register storage. The same register can be 
used for multiple variables as long as their uses (live ranges) do not overlap. 


---

 
  
The number of registers is very limited. There are approximately six integer registers 
available for general purposes in 32-bit operating systems and fourteen integer registers in 
64-bit systems. 
 
Floating point variables use a different kind of registers. There are eight floating point 
registers available in 32-bit operating systems and sixteen in 64-bit operating systems. 
Some compilers have difficulties making floating point register variables in 32-bit mode 
unless the SSE2 instruction set (or higher) is enabled. 
Volatile 
The volatile keyword specifies that a variable can be changed by another thread. This 
prevents the compiler from making optimizations that rely on the assumption that the 
variable always has the value it was assigned previously in the code. Example: 
 
// Example 7.3. Explain volatile 
volatile int seconds;  // incremented every second by another thread 
 
void DelayFiveSeconds() { 
   seconds = 0; 
   while (seconds < 5) { 
      // do nothing while seconds count to 5 
   } 
} 
 
In this example, the DelayFiveSeconds function will wait until seconds has been 
incremented to 5 by another thread. If seconds was not declared volatile then an 
optimizing compiler would assume that seconds remains zero in the while loop because 
nothing inside the loop can change the value. The loop would be while (0 < 5) {} 
which would be an infinite loop. 
 
The effect of the keyword volatile is that it makes sure the variable is stored in memory 
rather than in a register and prevents all optimizations on the variable. This can be useful in 
test situations to avoid that some expression is optimized away. 
 
Note that volatile doesn't mean atomic. It doesn't prevent two threads from attempting to 
write the variable at the same time. The code in the above example may fail in the event 
that it attempts to set seconds to zero at the same time as the other thread increments 
seconds. A safer implementation would only read the value of seconds and wait until the 
value has changed five times. 
Thread-local storage 
Most compilers can make thread-local storage of static and global variables by using the 
keyword __thread or __declspec(thread). Such variables have one instance for 
each thread. Thread-local storage is inefficient because it is accessed through a pointer 
stored in a thread environment block. Thread-local storage should be avoided, if possible, 
and replaced by storage on the stack (see above, p. 26). Variables stored on the stack 
always belong to the thread in which they are created. 
Far 
Systems with segmented memory, such as DOS and 16-bit Windows, allow variables to be 
stored in a far data segment by using the keyword far (arrays can also be huge). Far 
storage, far pointers, and far procedures are inefficient. If a program has too much data for 
one segment then it is recommended to use a different operating systems that allows bigger 
segments (32-bit or 64-bit systems). 


---

 
Dynamic memory allocation 
Dynamic memory allocation is done with the operators new and delete or with the 
functions malloc and free. These operators and functions consume a significant amount 
of time. A part of memory called the heap is reserved for dynamic allocation. The heap can 
easily become fragmented when objects of different sizes are allocated and deallocated in 
random order. The heap manager can spend a lot of time cleaning up spaces that are no 
longer used and searching for vacant spaces. This is called garbage collection. Objects that 
are allocated in sequence are not necessarily stored sequentially in memory. They may be 
scattered around at different places when the heap has become fragmented. This makes 
data caching inefficient. 
 
Dynamic memory allocation also tends to make the code more complicated and error-prone. 
The program has to keep pointers to all allocated objects and keep track of when they are 
no longer used. It is important that all allocated objects are also deallocated in all possible 
cases of program flow. Failure to do so is a common source of error known as memory leak. 
An even worse kind of error is to access an object after it has been deallocated. The 
program logic may need extra overhead to prevent such errors. 
 
See page 91 for a further discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of using dynamic 
memory allocation. 
 
Some programming languages, such as Java, use dynamic memory allocation for all 
objects. This is of course inefficient. 
Variables declared inside a class 
Variables declared inside a class are stored in the order in which they appear in the class 
declaration. The type of storage is determined where the object of the class is declared. An 
object of a class, structure or union can use any of the storage methods mentioned above. 
An object cannot be stored in a register except in the simplest cases, but its data members 
can be copied into registers. 
 
A class member variable with the static modifier will be stored in static memory and will 
have one and only one instance. Non-static members of the same class will be stored with 
each instance of the class. 
 
Storing variables in a class or structure is a good way of making sure that variables that are 
used in the same part of the program are also stored near each other. See page 52 for the 
pros and cons of using classes.

Table 7.1. Sizes of different integer types 
 
Unfortunately, the way of declaring an integer of a specific size is different for different 
platforms as shown in the above table. If the standard header file stdint.h or 
inttypes.h is available then it is recommended to use that for a portable way of defining 
integer types of a specific size. 
 
Integer operations are fast in most cases, regardless of the size. However, it is inefficient to 
use an integer size that is larger than the largest available register size. In other words, it is 
inefficient to use 32-bit integers in 16-bit systems or 64-bit integers in 32-bit systems, 
especially if the code involves multiplication or division. 
 
The compiler will always select the most efficient integer size if you declare an int, without 
specifying the size. Integers of smaller sizes (char, short int) are only slightly less 
efficient. In many cases, the compiler will convert these types to integers of the default size 
when doing calculations, and then use only the lower 8 or 16 bits of the result. You can 
assume that the type conversion takes zero or one clock cycle. In 64-bit systems, there is 
only a minimal difference between the efficiency of 32-bit integers and 64-bit integers, as 
long as you are not doing divisions. 
 
It is recommended to use the default integer size in cases where the size doesn't matter and 
there is no risk of overflow, such as simple variables, loop counters, etc. In large arrays, it 
may be preferred to use the smallest integer size that is big enough for the specific purpose 
in order to make better use of the data cache. Bit-fields of sizes other than 8, 16, 32 and 64 
bits are less efficient. In 64-bit systems, you may use 64-bit integers if the application can 
make use of the extra bits. 
 
The unsigned integer type size_t is 32 bits in 32-bit systems and 64 bits in 64-bit systems. 
It is intended for array sizes and array indices when you want to make sure that overflow 
never occurs, even for arrays bigger than 2 GB. 
 
When considering whether a particular integer size is big enough for a specific purpose, you 
must consider if intermediate calculations can cause overflow. For example, in the 
expression a = (b*c)/d, it can happen that (b*c) overflows, even if a, b, c and d would 
all be below the maximum value. There is no automatic check for integer overflow. 
 
Signed versus unsigned integers 
In most cases, there is no difference in speed between using signed and unsigned integers. 
But there are a few cases where it matters: 
 
 
Division by a constant: Unsigned is faster than signed when you divide an integer with a 
constant (see page 140). This also applies to the modulo operator %. 
   
 
Conversion to floating point is faster with signed than with unsigned integers for most 
instruction sets (see page 145). 


---

 
 
 
Overflow behaves differently on signed and unsigned variables. An overflow of an 
unsigned variable produces a low positive result. An overflow of a signed variable is 
officially undefined. The normal behavior is wrap-around of positive overflow to a 
negative value, but the compiler may optimize away branches that depend on overflow, 
based on the assumption that overflow does not occur.  
   
The conversion between signed and unsigned integers is costless. It is simply a matter of 
interpreting the same bits differently. A negative integer will be interpreted as a very large 
positive number when converted to unsigned. 
 
// Example 7.4. Signed and unsigned integers 
int a, b;  
double c; 
b = (unsigned int)a / 10;    // Convert to unsigned for fast division 
c = a * 2.5;                 // Use signed when converting to double 
 
In example 7.4 we are converting a to unsigned in order to make the division faster. Of 
course, this works only if it is certain that a will never be negative. The last line is implicitly 
converting a to double before multiplying with the constant 2.5, which is double. Here we 
prefer a to be signed. 
 
Be sure not to mix signed and unsigned integers in comparisons, such as <. The result of 
comparing signed with unsigned integers is ambiguous and may produce undesired results. 
Integer operators 
Integer operations are generally very fast. Simple integer operations such as addition, 
subtraction, comparison, bit operations and shift operations take only one clock cycle on 
most microprocessors. 
 
Multiplication and division take longer time. Integer multiplication takes 11 clock cycles on 
Pentium 4 processors, and 3 - 4 clock cycles on most other microprocessors. Integer 
division takes 40 - 80 clock cycles, depending on the microprocessor. Integer division is 
faster the smaller the integer size on AMD processors, but not on Intel processors. Details 
about instruction latencies are listed in manual 4: "Instruction tables". Tips about how to 
speed up multiplications and divisions are given on page 139 and 140, respectively. 
Increment and decrement operators 
The pre-increment operator ++i and the post-increment operator i++ are as fast as 
additions. When used simply to increment an integer variable, it makes no difference 
whether you use pre-increment or post-increment. The effect is simply identical. For 
example, 
for (i=0; i<n; i++) is the same as for (i=0; i<n; ++i). But when the result of 
the expression is used, then there may be a difference in efficiency. For example, 
x = array[i++] is more efficient than x = array[++i] because in the latter case, 
the calculation of the address of the array element has to wait for the new value of i which 
will delay the availability of x for approximately two clock cycles. Obviously, the initial value 
of i must be adjusted if you change pre-increment to post-increment. 
 
There are also situations where pre-increment is more efficient than post-increment. For 
example, in the case a = ++b; the compiler will recognize that the values of a and b are 
the same after this statement so that it can use the same register for both, while the 
expression a = b++; will make the values of a and b different so that they cannot use the 
same register. 
 
Everything that is said here about increment operators also applies to decrement operators 
on integer variables.

7.3 Floating point variables and operators 
Modern microprocessors in the x86 family have two different types of floating point registers 
and correspondingly two different types of floating point instructions. Each type has 
advantages and disadvantages. 
 
The original method of doing floating point operations involves eight floating point registers 
organized as a register stack. These registers have long double precision (80 bits). The 
advantages of using the register stack are: 
 
 
All calculations are done with long double precision. 
 
 
Conversions between different precisions take no extra time. 
 
 
There are intrinsic instructions for mathematical functions such as logarithms and 
trigonometric functions. 
 
 
The code is compact and takes little space in the code cache. 
 
The register stack also has disadvantages: 
 
 
It is difficult for the compiler to make register variables because of the way the register 
stack is organized. 
 
 
Floating point comparisons are slow unless the Pentium-II or later instruction set is 
enabled. 
 
 
Conversions between integers and floating point numbers is inefficient. 
 
 
Division, square root and mathematical functions take more time to calculate when long 
double precision is used. 
 
A newer method of doing floating point operations involves eight or sixteen vector registers 
(XMM or YMM) which can be used for multiple purposes. Floating point operations are done 
with single or double precision, and intermediate results are always calculated with the 
same precision as the operands. The advantages of using the vector registers are: 
 
 
It is easy to make floating point register variables. 
 
 
Vector operations are available for doing parallel calculations on vectors of two double 
precision or four single precision variables in the XMM registers (see page 107). If the 
AVX instruction set is available then each vector can hold four double precision or eight 
single precision variables in the YMM registers. 
 
Disadvantages are: 
 
 
Long double precision is not supported. 
 
 
The calculation of expressions where operands have mixed precision require precision 
conversion instructions which can be quite time-consuming (see page 143). 
 
 
Mathematical functions must use a function library, but this is often faster than the 
intrinsic hardware functions. 
 
The floating point stack registers are available in all systems that have floating point 
capabilities (except in device drivers for 64-bit Windows). The XMM vector registers are 


---

 
available in 64-bit systems and in 32-bit systems when the SSE2 or later instruction set is 
enabled (single precision requires only SSE). The YMM registers are available if the AVX 
instruction set is supported by the processor and the operating system. See page 125 for 
how to test for the availability of these instruction sets. 
 
Most compilers will use the XMM registers for floating point calculations whenever they are 
available, i.e. in 64-bit mode or when the SSE2 instruction set is enabled. Few compilers 
are able to mix the two types of floating point operations and choose the type that is optimal 
for each calculation. 
 
In most cases, double precision calculations take no more time than single precision. When 
the floating point registers are used, there is simply no difference in speed between single 
and double precision. Long double precision takes only slightly more time. Single precision 
division, square root and mathematical functions are calculated faster than double precision 
when the XMM registers are used, while the speed of addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
etc. is still the same regardless of precision on most processors (when vector operations are 
not used). 
 
You may use double precision without worrying too much about the costs if it is good for the 
application. You may use single precision if you have big arrays and want to get as much 
data as possible into the data cache. Single precision is good if you can take advantage of 
vector operations, as explained on page 107. 
 
Floating point addition takes 3 - 6 clock cycles, depending on the microprocessor. 
Multiplication takes 4 - 8 clock cycles. Division takes 14 - 45 clock cycles. Floating point 
comparisons are inefficient when the floating point stack registers are used. Conversions of 
float or double to integer takes a long time when the floating point stack registers are used.  
 
Do not mix single and double precision when the XMM registers are used. See page 143. 
 
Avoid conversions between integers and floating point variables, if possible. See page 144. 
 
Applications that generate floating point underflow in XMM registers can benefit from setting 
the flush-to-zero mode rather than generating subnormal numbers in case of underflow: 
 
// Example 7.5. Set flush-to-zero mode (SSE): 
#include <xmmintrin.h> 
_MM_SET_FLUSH_ZERO_MODE(_MM_FLUSH_ZERO_ON); 
 
It is strongly recommended to set the flush-to-zero mode unless you have special reasons 
to use subnormal numbers. You may, in addition, set the denormals-are-zero mode if SSE2 
is available: 
 
// Example 7.6. Set flush-to-zero and denormals-are-zero mode (SSE2): 
#include <xmmintrin.h> 
_mm_setcsr(_mm_getcsr() | 0x8040); 
 
See page 149 and 122 for more information about mathematical functions. 
 
7.4 Enums 
An enum is simply an integer in disguise. Enums are exactly as efficient as integers. 
 
Note that the enumerators (value names) will clash with any variable or function having the 
same name. Enums in header files should therefore have long and unique enumerator 
names or be put into a namespace. 
 


---

 
7.5 Booleans 
The order of Boolean operands 
The operands of the Boolean operators && and || are evaluated in the following way. If the 
first operand of && is false, then the second operand is not evaluated at all because the 
result is known to be false regardless of the value of the second operand. Likewise, if the 
first operand of || is true, then the second operand is not evaluated, because the result is 
known to be true anyway. 
 
It may be advantageous to put the operand that is most often true last in an && expression, 
or first in an || expression. Assume, for example, that a is true 50% of the time and b is 
true 10% of the time. The expression a && b needs to evaluate b when a is true, which is 
50% of the cases. The equivalent expression b && a needs to evaluate a only when b is 
true, which is only 10% of the time. This is faster if a and b take the same time to evaluate 
and are equally likely to be predicted by the branch prediction mechanism. See page 44 for 
an explanation of branch prediction. 
 
If one operand is more predictable than the other, then put the most predictable operand 
first.  
 
If one operand is faster to calculate than the other then put the operand that is calculated 
the fastest first. 
 
However, you must be careful when swapping the order of Boolean operands. You cannot 
swap the operands if the evaluation of the operands has side effects or if the first operand 
determines whether the second operand is valid. For example: 
 
// Example 7.7 
unsigned int i;  const int ARRAYSIZE = 100;  float list[ARRAYSIZE]; 
if (i < ARRAYSIZE && list[i] > 1.0) { ... 
 
Here, you cannot swap the order of the operands because the expression list[i] is 
invalid when i is not less than ARRAYSIZE. Another example: 
 
// Example 7.8 
if (handle != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE && WriteFile(handle, ...)) { ... 
 
Here you cannot swap the order of the Boolean operands because you should not call 
WriteFile if the handle is invalid. 
Boolean variables are overdetermined 
Boolean variables are stored as 8-bit integers with the value 0 for false and 1 for true. 
 
Boolean variables are overdetermined in the sense that all operators that have Boolean 
variables as input check if the inputs have any other value than 0 or 1, but operators that 
have Booleans as output can produce no other value than 0 or 1. This makes operations 
with Boolean variables as input less efficient than necessary. Take the example: 
 
// Example 7.9a 
bool a, b, c, d; 
c = a && b; 
d = a || b; 
 
This is typically implemented by the compiler in the following way: 
 
bool a, b, c, d; 
if (a != 0) { 


---

 
   if (b != 0) { 
      c = 1; 
   } 
   else { 
      goto CFALSE; 
   } 
} 
else { 
   CFALSE: 
   c = 0; 
} 
if (a == 0) { 
   if (b == 0) { 
      d = 0; 
   } 
   else { 
      goto DTRUE; 
   } 
} 
else { 
   DTRUE: 
   d = 1; 
} 
 
This is of course far from optimal. The branches may take a long time in case of 
mispredictions (see page 44). The Boolean operations can be made much more efficient if it 
is known with certainty that the operands have no other values than 0 and 1. The reason 
why the compiler doesn't make such an assumption is that the variables might have other 
values if they are uninitialized or come from unknown sources. The above code can be 
optimized if a and b have been initialized to valid values or if they come from operators that 
produce Boolean output. The optimized code looks like this: 
 
// Example 7.9b 
char a = 0, b = 0, c, d; 
c = a & b; 
d = a | b; 
 
Here, I have used char (or int) instead of bool in order to make it possible to use the 
bitwise operators (& and |) instead of the Boolean operators (&& and ||). The bitwise 
operators are single instructions that take only one clock cycle. The OR operator (|) works 
even if a and b have other values than 0 or 1. The AND operator (&) and the EXCLUSIVE 
OR operator (^) may give inconsistent results if the operands have other values than 0 and 
1. 
 
Note that there are a few pitfalls here. You cannot use ~ for NOT. Instead, you can make a 
Boolean NOT on a variable which is known to be 0 or 1 by XOR'ing it with 1: 
 
// Example 7.10a 
bool a, b; 
b = !a; 
 
can be optimized to: 
 
// Example 7.10b 
char a = 0, b; 
b = a ^ 1; 
 
You cannot replace a && b with a & b if b is an expression that should not be 
evaluated if a is false. Likewise, you cannot replace a || b with a | b if b is an 
expression that should not be evaluated if a is true. 


---

 
 
The trick of using bitwise operators is more advantageous if the operands are variables than 
if the operands are comparisons, etc. For example: 
 
// Example 7.11 
bool a; float x, y, z; 
a = x > y && z != 0; 
 
This is optimal in most cases. Don't change && to & unless you expect the && expression to 
generate many branch mispredictions. 
Boolean vector operations 
An integer may be used as a Boolean vector. For example, if a and b are 32-bit integers, 
then the expression y = a & b; will make 32 AND-operations in just one clock cycle. 
The operators &, |, ^, ~ are useful for Boolean vector operations. 
 
7.6 Pointers and references 
Pointers versus references 
Pointers and references are equally efficient because they are in fact doing the same thing. 
Example: 
 
// Example 7.12 
void FuncA (int * p) { 
   *p = *p + 2; 
} 
 
void FuncB (int & r) { 
   r = r + 2; 
} 
 
These two functions are doing the same thing and if you look at the code generated by the 
compiler you will notice that the code is exactly identical for the two functions. The 
difference is simply a matter of programming style. The advantages of using pointers rather 
than references are: 
 
 
When you look at the function bodies above, it is clear that p is a pointer, but it is not 
clear whether r is a reference or a simple variable. Using pointers makes it more clear 
to the reader what is happening. 
 
 
It is possible to do things with pointers that are impossible with references. You can 
change what a pointer points to and you can do arithmetic operations with pointers. 
 
The advantages of using references rather than pointers are: 
 
 
The syntax is simpler when using references. 
 
 
References are safer to use than pointers because in most cases they are sure to point 
to a valid address. Pointers can be invalid and cause fatal errors if they are uninitialized, 
if pointer arithmetic calculations go outside the bounds of valid addresses, or if pointers 
are type-casted to a wrong type. 
 
 
References are useful for copy constructors and overloaded operators. 
 
 
Function parameters that are declared as constant references accept expressions as 
arguments while pointers and non-constant references require a variable.

Efficiency 
Accessing a variable or object through a pointer or reference may be just as fast as 
accessing it directly. The reason for this efficiency lies in the way microprocessors are 
constructed. All non-static variables and objects declared inside a function are stored on the 
stack and are in fact addressed relative to the stack pointer. Likewise, all non-static 
variables and objects declared in a class are accessed through the implicit pointer known in 
C++ as 'this'. We can therefore conclude that most variables in a well-structured C++ 
program are in fact accessed through pointers in one way or another. Therefore, micro-
processors have to be designed so as to make pointers efficient, and that's what they are. 
 
However, there are disadvantages of using pointers and references. Most importantly, it 
requires an extra register to hold the value of the pointer or reference. Registers are a 
scarce resource, especially in 32-bit mode. If there are not enough registers then the pointer 
has to be loaded from memory each time it is used and this will make the program slower. 
Another disadvantage is that the value of the pointer is needed a few clock cycles before 
the time the variable pointed to can be accessed. 
Pointer arithmetic 
A pointer is in fact an integer that holds a memory address. Pointer arithmetic operations 
are therefore as fast as integer arithmetic operations. When an integer is added to a pointer 
then its value is multiplied by the size of the object pointed to. For example: 
 
// Example 7.13 
struct abc {int a; int b; int c;}; 
abc * p; int i; 
p = p + i; 
 
Here, the value that is added to p is not i but i*12, because the size of abc is 12 bytes. 
The time it takes to add i to p is therefore equal to the time it takes to make a multiplication 
and an addition. If the size of abc is a power of 2 then the multiplication can be replaced by 
a shift operation which is much faster. In the above example, the size of abc can be 
increased to 16 bytes by adding one more integer to the structure. 
 
Incrementing or decrementing a pointer does not require a multiplication but only an 
addition. Comparing two pointers requires only an integer comparison, which is fast. 
Calculating the difference between two pointers requires a division, which is slow unless the 
size of the type of object pointed to is a power of 2 (See page 140 about division). 
 
The object pointed to can be accessed approximately two clock cycles after the value of the 
pointer has been calculated. Therefore, it is recommended to calculate the value of a 
pointer well before the pointer is used. For example, x = *(p++) is more efficient than 
x = *(++p) because in the latter case the reading of x must wait until a few clock cycles 
after the pointer p has been incremented, while in the former case x can be read before p is 
incremented. See page 31 for more discussion of the increment and decrement operators. 
 
7.7 Function pointers 
Calling a function through a function pointer typically takes a few clock cycles more than 
calling the function directly if the target address can be predicted. The target address is 
predicted if the value of the function pointer is the same as last time the statement was 
executed. If the value of the function pointer has changed then the target address is likely to 
be mispredicted, which causes a long delay. See page 44 about branch prediction. A 
Pentium M processor may be able to predict the target if the changes of the function pointer 
follows a simple regular pattern, while Pentium 4 and AMD processors are sure to make a 
misprediction every time the function pointer has changed. 
 


---

 
7.8 Member pointers 
In simple cases, a data member pointer simply stores the offset of a data member relative to 
the beginning of the object, and a member function pointer is simply the address of the 
member function. But there are special cases such as multiple inheritance where a much 
more complicated implementation is needed. These complicated cases should definitely be 
avoided. 
 
A compiler has to use the most complicated implementation of member pointers if it has 
incomplete information about the class that the member pointer refers to. For example: 
 
// Example 7.14 
class c1; 
int c1::*MemberPointer; 
 
Here, the compiler has no information about the class c1 other than its name at the time 
MemberPointer is declared. Therefore, it has to assume the worst possible case and 
make a complicated implementation of the member pointer. This can be avoided by making 
the full declaration of c1 before MemberPointer is declared. Avoid multiple inheritance, 
virtual functions, and other complications that make member pointers less efficient. 
 
Most C++ compilers have various options to control the way member pointers are 
implemented. Use the option that gives the simplest possible implementation if possible, 
and make sure you are using the same compiler option for all modules that use the same 
member pointer. 
 
7.9 Smart pointers 
A smart pointer is an object that behaves like a pointer. It has the special feature that the 
object it points to is deleted when the pointer is deleted. Smart pointers are used only for 
objects stored in dynamically allocated memory, using new. The purpose of using smart 
pointers is to make sure the object is deleted properly and the memory released when the 
object is no longer used. A smart pointer may be considered a container that contains only a 
single element. 
 
The most common implementations of smart pointers are auto_ptr and shared_ptr.  
auto_ptr has the feature that there is always one, and only one, auto_ptr that owns the 
allocated object, and ownership is transferred from one auto_ptr to another by 
assignment. shared_ptr allows multiple pointers to the same object. 
 
There is no extra cost to accessing an object through a smart pointer. Accessing an object 
by *p or p->member is equally fast whether p is a simple pointer or a smart pointer. But 
there is an extra cost whenever a smart pointer is created, deleted, copied or transferred 
from one function to another. These costs are higher for shared_ptr than for auto_ptr. 
 
Smart pointers can be useful in the situation where the logic structure of a program dictates 
that an object must be dynamically created by one function and later deleted by another 
function and these two functions are unrelated to each other (not member of the same 
class). If the same function or class is responsible for creating and deleting the object then 
you don't need a smart pointer. 
 
If a program uses many small dynamically allocated objects with each their smart pointer 
then you may consider if the cost of this solution is too high. It may be more efficient to pool 
all the objects together into a single container, preferably with contiguous memory. See the 
discussion of container classes on page 94.

7.10 Arrays 
An array is implemented simply by storing the elements consecutively in memory. No 
information about the dimensions of the array is stored. This makes the use of arrays in C 
and C++ faster than in other programming languages, but also less safe. This safety 
problem can be overcome by defining a container class that behaves like an array with 
bounds checking, as illustrated in this example: 
 
// Example 7.15a. Array with bounds checking 
template <typename T, unsigned int N> class SafeArray { 
protected: 
   T a[N];                      // Array with N elements of type T 
public: 
   SafeArray() {                // Constructor 
      memset(a, 0, sizeof(a));  // Initialize to zero 
   } 
   int Size() {                 // Return the size of the array 
      return N; 
   } 
   T & operator[] (unsigned int i) { // Safe [] array index operator 
      if (i >= N) { 
         // Index out of range. The next line provokes an error. 
         // You may insert any other error reporting here: 
         return *(T*)0;   // Return a null reference to provoke error 
      } 
      // No error 
      return a[i];     // Return reference to a[i] 
   } 
}; 
 
More examples of container classes are given in www.agner.org/optimize/cppexamples.zip. 
 
An array using the above template class is declared by specifying the type and size as 
template parameters, as example 7.15b below shows. It is accessed with a square brackets 
index, just as a normal array. The constructor sets all elements to zero. You may remove 
the memset line if you don't want this initialization, or if the type T is a class with a default 
constructor that does the necessary initialization. The compiler may report that memset is 
deprecated. This is because it can cause errors if the size parameter is wrong, but it is still 
the fastest way to set an array to zero. The [] operator will detect an error if the index is out 
of range (see page 137 on bounds checking). An error message is provoked here in a 
rather unconventional manner by returning a null reference. This will provoke an error 
message in a protected operating system if the array element is accessed, and this error is 
easy to trace with a debugger. You may replace this line by any other form of error 
reporting. For example, in Windows, you may write FatalAppExitA(0,"Array index 
out of range"); or better, make your own error message function. 
 
The following example illustrates how to use SafeArray: 
 
// Example 7.15b 
SafeArray <float, 100> list;            // Make array of 100 floats 
for (int i = 0; i < list.Size(); i++) { // Loop through array 
   cout << list[i] << endl;             // Output array element 
} 
 
An array initialized by a list should preferably be static, as explained on page 27. An array 
can be initialized to zero by using memset: 
 
// Example 7.16 
float list[100]; 
memset(list, 0, sizeof(list)); 
 


---

 
A multidimensional array should be organized so that the last index changes fastest: 
 
// Example 7.17 
const int rows = 20, columns = 50; 
float matrix[rows][columns]; 
int i, j;  float x; 
   for (i = 0; i < rows; i++) 
      for (j = 0; j < columns; j++) 
         matrix[i][j] += x; 
 
This makes sure that the elements are accessed sequentially. The opposite order of the two 
loops would make the access non-sequential which makes the data caching less efficient. 
 
The size of all but the first dimension may preferably be a power of 2 if the rows are indexed 
in a non-sequential order in order to make the address calculation more efficient: 
 
// Example 7.18 
int FuncRow(int);  int FuncCol(int); 
const int rows = 20, columns = 32; 
float matrix[rows][columns]; 
int i;  float x; 
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) 
   matrix[FuncRow(i)][FuncCol(i)] += x; 
 
Here, the code must compute (FuncRow(i)*columns + FuncCol(i)) * 
sizeof(float) in order to find the address of the matrix element. The multiplication by 
columns in this case is faster when columns is a power of two. In the preceding example, 
this is not an issue because an optimizing compiler can see that the rows are accessed 
consecutively and can calculate the address of each row by adding the length of a row to 
the address of the preceding row.  
 
The same advice applies to arrays of structure or class objects. The size (in bytes) of the 
objects should preferably be a power of 2 if the elements are accessed in a non-sequential 
order. 
 
The advice of making the number of columns a power of 2 does not always apply to arrays 
that are bigger than the level-1 data cache and accessed non-sequentially because it may 
cause cache contentions. See page 88 for a discussion of this problem. 
 
7.11 Type conversions 
The C++ syntax has several different ways of doing type conversions: 
 
// Example 7.19 
int i;  float f; 
f = i;                      // Implicit type conversion 
f = (float)i;               // C-style type casting 
f = float(i);               // Constructor-style type casting 
f = static_cast<float>(i);  // C++ casting operator 
 
These different methods have exactly the same effect. Which method you use is a matter of 
programming style. The time consumption of different type conversions is discussed below. 
Signed / unsigned conversion 
 
// Example 7.20 
int i; 
if ((unsigned int)i < 10) { ... 
 


---

 
Conversions between signed and unsigned integers simply makes the compiler interpret the 
bits of the integer in a different way. There is no checking for overflow, and the code takes 
no extra time. These conversions can be used freely without any cost in performance. 
Integer size conversion 
 
// Example 7.21 
int i;  short int s; 
i = s; 
 
An integer is converted to a longer size by extending the sign-bit if the integer is signed, or 
by extending with zero-bits if unsigned. This typically takes one clock cycle if the source is 
an arithmetic expression. The size conversion often takes no extra time if it is done in 
connection with reading the value from a variable in memory, as in example 7.22. 
 
// Example 7.22 
short int a[100];  int i, sum = 0; 
for (i=0; i<100; i++) sum += a[i]; 
 
Converting an integer to a smaller size is done simply by ignoring the higher bits. There is 
no check for overflow. Example: 
 
// Example 7.23 
int i;  short int s; 
s = (short int)i; 
 
This conversion takes no extra time. It simply stores the lower 16 bits of the 32-bit integer. 
Floating point precision conversion 
Conversions between float, double and long double take no extra time when the 
floating point register stack is used. It takes between 2 and 15 clock cycles (depending on 
the processor) when the XMM registers are used. See page 32 for an explanation of 
register stack versus XMM registers. Example: 
 
// Example 7.24 
float a; double b; 
a += b; 
 
In this example, the conversion is costly if XMM registers are used. a and b should be of the 
same type to avoid this. See page 143 for further discussion. 
Integer to float conversion 
Conversion of a signed integer to a float or double takes 4 - 16 clock cycles, depending 
on the processor and the type of registers used. Conversion of an unsigned integer takes 
longer time. It is faster to first convert the unsigned integer to a signed integer if there is no 
risk of overflow: 
 
// Example 7.25 
unsigned int u;  double d; 
d = (double)(signed int)u;  // Faster, but risk of overflow 
 
Integer to float conversions can sometimes be avoided by replacing an integer variable by a 
float variable. Example: 
 
// Example 7.26a 
float a[100];  int i; 
for (i = 0;  i < 100;  i++) a[i] = 2 * i; 
 


---

 
The conversion of i to float in this example can be avoided by making an additional floating 
point variable: 
 
// Example 7.26b 
float a[100];  int i;  float i2; 
for (i = 0, i2 = 0;  i < 100;  i++, i2 += 2.0f) a[i] = i2; 
Float to integer conversion 
Conversion of a floating point number to an integer takes a very long time unless the SSE2 
or later instruction set is enabled. Typically, the conversion takes 50 - 100 clock cycles. The 
reason is that the C/C++ standard specifies truncation so the floating point rounding mode 
has to be changed to truncation and back again.  
 
If there are floating point-to-integer conversions in the critical part of a code then it is 
important to do something about it. Possible solutions are: 
 
Avoid the conversions by using different types of variables. 
 
Move the conversions out of the innermost loop by storing intermediate results as 
floating point. 
 
Use 64-bit mode or enable the SSE2 instruction set (requires a microprocessor that 
supports this). 
 
Use rounding instead of truncation and make a round function using assembly 
language. See page 144 for details about rounding. 
 
Pointer type conversion 
A pointer can be converted to a pointer of a different type. Likewise, a pointer can be 
converted to an integer, or an integer can be converted to a pointer. It is important that the 
integer has enough bits for holding the pointer. 
 
These conversions do not produce any extra code. It is simply a matter of interpreting the 
same bits in a different way or bypassing syntax checks. 
 
These conversions are not safe, of course. It is the responsibility of the programmer to 
make sure the result is valid. 
Re-interpreting the type of an object 
It is possible to make the compiler treat a variable or object as if it had a different type by 
type-casting its address: 
 
// Example 7.27 
float x; 
*(int*)&x |= 0x80000000;   // Set sign bit of x 
 
The syntax may seem a little odd here. The address of x is type-casted to a pointer to an 
integer, and this pointer is then de-referenced in order to access x as an integer. The 
compiler does not produce any extra code for actually making a pointer. The pointer is 
simply optimized away and the result is that x is treated as an integer. But the & operator 
forces the compiler to store x in memory rather than in a register. The above example sets 
the sign bit of x by using the | operator which otherwise can only be applied to integers. It is 
faster than x = -abs(x);.  
 
There are a number of dangers to be aware of when type-casting pointers: 
 


---

 
 
The trick violates the strict aliasing rule of standard C, specifying that two pointers of 
different types cannot point to the same object (except for char pointers). An 
optimizing compiler might store the floating point and integer representations in two 
different registers. You need to check if the compiler does what you want it to. It is 
safer to use a union, as in example 14.23 page 146. 
 
The trick will fail if the object is treated as bigger than it actually is. This above code 
will fail if an int uses more bits than a float. (Both use 32 bits in x86 systems). 
 
If you access part of a variable, for example 32 bits of a 64-bit double, then the code 
will not be portable to platforms that use big endian storage. 
 
If you access a variable in parts, for example if you write a 64-bit double 32 bits at a 
time, then the code is likely to execute slower than intended because of a store 
forwarding delay in the CPU (See manual 3: "The microarchitecture of Intel, AMD 
and VIA CPUs"). 
Const cast 
The const_cast operator is used for relieving the const restriction from a pointer. It has 
some syntax checking and is therefore more safe than the C-style type-casting without 
adding any extra code. Example: 
 
// Example 7.28 
class c1 { 
   const int x;       // constant data 
   public: 
   c1() : x(0) {};    // constructor initializes x to 0 
   void xplus2() {    // this function can modify x 
      *const_cast<int*>(&x) += 2;}  // add 2 to x 
}; 
 
The effect of the const_cast operator here is to remove the const restriction on x. It is a 
way of relieving a syntax restriction, but it doesn't generate any extra code and doesn't take 
any extra time. This is a useful way of making sure that one function can modify x, while 
other functions can not. 
Static cast 
The static_cast operator does the same as the C-style type-casting. It is used, for 
example, to convert float to int. 
Reinterpret cast 
The reinterpret_cast operator is used for pointer conversions. It does the same as C-
style type-casting with a little more syntax check. It does not produce any extra code. 
Dynamic cast 
The dynamic_cast operator is used for converting a pointer to one class to a pointer to 
another class. It makes a runtime check that the conversion is valid. For example, when a 
pointer to a base class is converted to a pointer to a derived class, it checks whether the 
original pointer actually points to an object of the derived class. This check makes 
dynamic_cast more time-consuming than a simple type casting, but also safer. It may 
catch programming errors that would otherwise go undetected. 
Converting class objects 
Conversions involving class objects (rather than pointers to objects) are possible only if the 
programmer has defined a constructor, an overloaded assignment operator, or an over-
loaded type casting operator that specifies how to do the conversion. The constructor or 
overloaded operator is as efficient as a member function.

7.12 Branches and switch statements 
The high speed of modern microprocessors is obtained by using a pipeline where 
instructions are fetched and decoded in several stages before they are executed. However, 
the pipeline structure has one big problem. Whenever the code has a branch (e.g. an if-else 
structure), the microprocessor doesn't know in advance which of the two branches to feed 
into the pipeline. If the wrong branch is fed into the pipeline then the error is not detected 
until 10 - 20 clock cycles later and the work it has done by fetching, decoding and perhaps 
speculatively executing instructions during this time has been wasted. The consequence is 
that the microprocessor wastes several clock cycles whenever it feeds a branch into the 
pipeline and later discovers that it has chosen the wrong branch. 
 
Microprocessor designers have gone to great lengths to reduce this problem. The most 
important method that is used is branch prediction. Modern microprocessors are using 
advanced algorithms to predict which way a branch will go based on the past history of that 
branch and other nearby branches. The algorithms used for branch prediction are different 
for each type of microprocessor. These algorithms are described in detail in manual 3: "The 
microarchitecture of Intel, AMD and VIA CPUs". 
 
A branch instruction takes typically 0 - 2 clock cycles in the case that the microprocessor 
has made the right prediction. The time it takes to recover from a branch misprediction is 
approximately 12 - 25 clock cycles, depending on the processor. This is called the branch 
misprediction penalty. 
 
Branches are relatively cheap if they are predicted most of the time, but expensive if they 
are often mispredicted. A branch that always goes the same way is predicted well, of 
course. A branch that goes one way most of the time and rarely the other way is 
mispredicted only when it goes the other way. A branch that goes many times one way, 
then many times the other way is mispredicted only when it changes. A branch that follows 
a simple periodic pattern can also be predicted quite well if it is inside a loop with few or no 
other branches. A simple periodic pattern can be, for example, to go one way two times and 
the other way three times. Then again two times the first way and three times the other way, 
etc. The worst case is a branch that goes randomly one way or the other with a 50-50 
chance of going either way. Such a branch will be mispredicted 50% of the time. 
 
A for-loop or while-loop is also a kind of branch. After each iteration it decides whether to 
repeat or to exit the loop. The loop-branch is usually predicted well if the repeat count is 
small and always the same. The maximum loop count that can be predicted perfectly varies 
between 9 and 64, depending on the processor. Nested loops are predicted well only on 
some processors. On many processors, a loop that contains several branches is not 
predicted well. 
 
A switch statements is a kind of branch that can go more than two ways. Switch statements 
are most efficient if the case labels follow a sequence where each label is equal to the 
preceding label plus one, because it can be implemented as a table of jump targets. A 
switch statement with many labels that have values far from each other is inefficient 
because the compiler must convert it to a branch tree. 
 
On older processors, a switch statement with sequential labels is simply predicted to go the 
same way as last time it was executed. It is therefore certain to be mispredicted whenever it 
goes another way than last time. Newer processors are sometimes able to predict a switch 
statement if it follows a simple periodic pattern or if it is correlated with preceding branches 
and the number of different targets is small. 
 
The number of branches and switch statements should preferably be kept small in the 
critical part of a program, especially if the branches are poorly predictable. It may be useful 
to roll out a loop if this can eliminate branches, as explained in the next paragraph. 
 


---

 
The target of branches and function calls are saved in a special cache called the branch 
target buffer. Contentions in the branch target buffer can occur if a program has many 
branches or function calls. The consequence of such contentions is that branches can be 
mispredicted even if they otherwise would be predicted well. Even function calls can be 
mispredicted for this reason. A program with many branches and function calls in the critical 
part of the code can therefore suffer from mispredictions. 
 
In some cases it is possible to replace a poorly predictable branch by a table lookup. For 
example: 
 
// Example 7.29a 
float a;  bool b; 
a = b ? 1.5f : 2.6f; 
 
The ?: operator here is a branch. If it is poorly predictable then replace it by a table lookup: 
 
// Example 7.29b 
float a;  bool b = 0; 
const float lookup[2] = {2.6f, 1.5f}; 
a = lookup[b]; 
 
If a bool is used as an array index then it is important to make sure it is initialized or comes 
from a reliable source so that it can have no other values than 0 or 1. See page 34. 
 
In some cases the compiler can automatically replace a branch by a conditional move, 
depending on the specified instruction set. 
 
The examples on page 137 and 138 show various ways of reducing the number of 
branches. 
 
Manual 3: "The microarchitecture of Intel, AMD and VIA CPUs" gives more details on 
branch predictions in the different microprocessors. 
 
7.13 Loops 
The efficiency of a loop depends on how well the microprocessor can predict the loop 
control branch. See the preceding paragraph and manual 3: "The microarchitecture of Intel, 
AMD and VIA CPUs" for an explanation of branch prediction. A loop with a small and fixed 
repeat count and no branches inside can be predicted perfectly. As explained above, the 
maximum loop count that can be predicted depends on the processor. Nested loops are 
predicted well only on some processors that have a special loop predictor. On other 
processors, only the innermost loop is predicted well. A loop with a high repeat count is 
mispredicted only when it exits. For example, if a loop repeats a thousand times then the 
loop control branch is mispredicted only one time in thousand so the misprediction penalty 
is only a negligible contribution to the total execution time. 
Loop unrolling 
In some cases it can be an advantage to unroll a loop. Example: 
 
// Example 7.30a 
int i; 
for (i = 0; i < 20; i++) { 
   if (i % 2 == 0) { 
      FuncA(i); 
   } 
   else { 
      FuncB(i); 
   } 
   FuncC(i); 


---

 
} 
 
This loop repeats 20 times and calls alternately FuncA and FuncB, then FuncC. Unrolling 
the loop by two gives: 
 
// Example 7.30b 
int i; 
for (i = 0; i < 20; i += 2) { 
   FuncA(i); 
   FuncC(i); 
   FuncB(i+1); 
   FuncC(i+1); 
} 
 
This has three advantages: 
 
 
The i<20 loop control branch is executed 10 times rather than 20. 
 
 
The fact that the repeat count has been reduced from 20 to 10 means that it can be 
predicted perfectly on a Pentium 4. 
 
 
The if branch is eliminated. 
 
Loop unrolling also has disadvantages: 
 
 
The unrolled loop takes up more space in the code cache or micro-op cache. 
   
 
The Core2 processor performs better on very small loops (less than 65 bytes of code). 
 
 
If the repeat count is odd and you unroll by two then there is an extra iteration that has 
to be done outside the loop. In general, you have this problem when the repeat count is 
not certain to be divisible by the unroll factor. 
 
Loop unrolling should only be used if there are specific advantages that can be obtained. If 
a loop contains floating point calculations and the loop counter is an integer, then you can 
generally assume that the overall computation time is determined by the floating point code 
rather than by the loop control branch. There is nothing to gain by unrolling the loop in this 
case. 
 
Loop unrolling should preferably be avoided on processors with a micro-op cache (e.g. 
Sandy Bridge) because it is important to economize the use of the micro-op cache. 
 
Compilers will usually unroll a loop automatically if this appears to be profitable (see page 
71). The programmer does not have to unroll a loop manually unless there is a specific 
advantage to obtain, such as eliminating the if-branch in example 7.30b. 
The loop control condition 
The most efficient loop control condition is a simple integer counter. A microprocessor with 
out-of-order capabilities (see page 105) will be able to evaluate the loop control statement 
several iterations ahead. 
 
It is less efficient if the loop control branch depends on the calculations inside the loop. The 
following example converts a zero-terminated ASCII string to lower case: 
 
// Example 7.31a 
char string[100], *p = string; 
while (*p != 0) *(p++) |= 0x20; 
 


---

 
If the length of the string is already known then it is more efficient to use a loop counter: 
 
// Example 7.31b 
char string[100], *p = string;  int i, StringLength; 
for (i = StringLength; i > 0; i--) *(p++) |= 0x20; 
 
A common situation where the loop control branch depends on calculations inside the loop 
is in mathematical iterations such as Taylor expansions and Newton-Raphson iterations. 
Here the iteration is repeated until the residual error is lower than a certain tolerance. The 
time it takes to calculate the absolute value of the residual error and compare it to the 
tolerance may be so high that it is more efficient to determine the worst-case maximum 
repeat count and always use this number of iterations. The advantage of this method is that 
the microprocessor can execute the loop control branch ahead of time and resolve any 
branch misprediction long before the floating point calculations inside the loop are finished. 
This method is advantageous if the typical repeat count is near the maximum repeat count 
and the calculation of the residual error for each iteration is a significant contribution to the 
total calculation time. 
  
A loop counter should preferably be an integer. If a loop needs a floating point counter then 
make an additional integer counter. Example: 
 
// Example 7.32a 
double x, n, factorial = 1.0; 
for (x = 2.0; x <= n; x++) factorial *= x; 
 
This can be improved by adding an integer counter and using the integer in the loop control 
condition: 
 
// Example 7.32b 
double x, n, factorial = 1.0;  int i; 
for (i = (int)n - 2, x = 2.0; i >= 0; i--, x++) factorial *= x; 
 
Note the difference between commas and semicolons in a loop with multiple counters, as in 
example 7.32b. A for-loop has three clauses: initialization, condition, and increment. The 
three clauses are separated by semicolons, while multiple statements within each clause 
are separated by commas. There should be only one statement in the condition clause. 
 
Comparing an integer to zero is sometimes more efficient than comparing it to any other 
number. Therefore, it is slightly more efficient to make a loop count down to zero than 
making it count up to some positive value, n. But not if the loop counter is used as an array 
index. The data cache is optimized for accessing arrays forwards, not backwards. 
Copying or clearing arrays 
It may not be optimal to use a loop for trivial tasks such as copying an array or setting an 
array to all zeroes. Example: 
 
// Example 7.33a 
const int size = 1000;  int i; 
float a[size], b[size]; 
// set a to zero 
for (i = 0; i < size; i++) a[i] = 0.0; 
// copy a to b 
for (i = 0; i < size; i++) b[i] = a[i]; 
 
It is often faster to use the functions memset and memcpy: 
 
// Example 7.33b 
const int size = 1000; 
float a[size], b[size]; 


---

 
// set a to zero 
memset(a, 0, sizeof(a)); 
// copy a to b 
memcpy(b, a, sizeof(b)); 
 
Most compilers will automatically replace such loops by calls to memset and memcpy, at 
least in simple cases. The explicit use of memset and memcpy is unsafe because serious 
errors can happen if the size parameter is bigger than the destination array. But the same 
errors can happen with the loops if the loop count is too big. 
 
7.14 Functions 
Function calls may slow down a program for the following reasons: 
 
 
The function call makes the microprocessor jump to a different code address and back 
again. This may take up to 4 clock cycles. In most cases the microprocessor is able to 
overlap the call and return operations with other calculations to save time. 
 
 
The code cache works less efficiently if the code is fragmented and scattered around in 
memory. 
 
 
Function parameters are stored on the stack in 32-bit mode. Storing the parameters on 
the stack and reading them again takes extra time. The delay is significant if a 
parameter is part of a critical dependency chain. 
 
 
Extra time is needed for setting up a stack frame, saving and restoring registers, and 
possibly save exception handling information. 
 
 
Each function call statement occupies a space in the branch target buffer (BTB). 
Contentions in the BTB can cause branch mispredictions if the critical part of a program 
has many calls and branches. 
 
The following methods may be used for reducing the time spent on function calls in the 
critical part of a program. 
Avoid unnecessary functions 
Some programming textbooks recommend that every function that is longer than a few lines 
should be split up into multiple functions. I disagree with this rule. Splitting up a function into 
multiple smaller functions only makes the program less efficient. Splitting up a function just 
because it is long does not make the program more clear unless the function is doing 
multiple logically distinct tasks. A critical innermost loop should preferably be kept entirely 
inside one function, if possible. 
Use inline functions 
An inline function is expanded like a macro so that each statement that calls the function is 
replaced by the function body. A function is usually inlined if the inline keyword is used or 
if its body is defined inside a class definition. Inlining a function is advantageous if the 
function is small or if it is called only from one place in the program. Small functions are 
often inlined automatically by the compiler. On the other hand, the compiler may in some 
cases ignore a request for inlining a function if the inlining causes technical problems or 
performance problems. 
Avoid nested function calls in the innermost loop 
A function that calls other functions is called a frame function, while a function that does not 
call any other function is called a leaf function. Leaf functions are more efficient than frame 
functions for reasons explained on page 63. If the critical innermost loop of a program 
contains calls to frame functions then the code can probably be improved by inlining the 


---

 
frame function or by turning the frame function into a leaf function by inlining all the 
functions that it calls. 
Use macros instead of functions 
A macro declared with #define is certain to be inlined. But beware that macro parameters 
are evaluated every time they are used. Example: 
 
// Example 7.34a. Use macro as inline function 
#define MAX(a,b) (a > b ? a : b) 
y = MAX(f(x), g(x)); 
 
In this example, f(x) or g(x) is calculated twice because the macro is referencing it twice. 
 
You can avoid this by using an inline function instead of a macro. If you want the function to 
work with any type of parameters then make it a template: 
 
// Example 7.34b. Replace macro by template 
template <typename T> 
static inline T max(T const & a, T const & b) { 
   return a > b ? a : b; 
} 
 
Another problem with macros is that the name cannot be overloaded or limited in scope. A 
macro will interfere with any function or variable having the same name, regardless of scope 
or namespaces. Therefore, it is important to use long and unique names for macros, 
especially in header files. 
Use fastcall functions 
The keyword __fastcall changes the function calling method in 32-bit mode so that the 
first two (three on CodeGear compiler) integer parameters are transferred in registers rather 
than on the stack. This can improve the speed of functions with integer parameters. 
 
Floating point parameters are not affected by __fastcall. The implicit 'this' pointer in 
member functions is also treated like a parameter, so there may be only one free register 
left for transferring additional parameters. Therefore, make sure that the most critical integer 
parameter comes first when you are using __fastcall. Function parameters are 
transferred in registers by default in 64-bit mode. Therefore, the __fastcall keyword is 
not recognized in 64-bit mode. 
Make functions local 
A function that is used only within the same module (i.e. the current .cpp file) should be 
made local. This makes it easier for the compiler to inline the function and to optimize 
across function calls. There are three ways to make a function local: 
 
1. Add the keyword static to the function declaration. This is the simplest method, 
but it doesn't work with class member functions, where static has a different 
meaning. 
   
2. Put the function or class into an anonymous namespace. 
   
3. The Gnu compiler allows "__attribute__((visibility("hidden")))". 
Use whole program optimization 
Some compilers have an option for whole program optimization or for combining multiple 
.cpp files into a single object file. This enables the compiler to optimize register allocation 


---

 
and parameter transfer across all .cpp modules that make up a program. Whole program 
optimization cannot be used for function libraries distributed as object or library files. 
Use 64-bit mode 
Parameter transfer is more efficient in 64-bit mode than in 32-bit mode, and more efficient in 
64-bit Linux than in 64-bit Windows. In 64-bit Linux, the first six integer parameters and the 
first eight floating point parameters are transferred in registers, totaling up to fourteen 
register parameters. In 64-bit Windows, the first four parameters are transferred in registers, 
regardless of whether they are integers or floating point numbers. Therefore, 64-bit Linux is 
more efficient than 64-bit Windows if functions have more than four parameters. There is no 
difference between 32-bit Linux and 32-bit Windows in this respect. 
 
7.15 Function parameters 
Function parameters are transferred by value in most cases. This means that the value of 
the parameter is copied to a local variable. This is efficient for simple types such as int, 
float, double, bool, enum as well as pointers and references. 
 
Arrays are always transferred as pointers unless they are wrapped into a class or structure. 
 
The situation is more complex if the parameter has a composite type such as a structure or 
class. The transfer of a parameter of composite type is most efficient if all of the following 
conditions are met: 
 
 
the object is so small that it fits into a single register 
 
the object has no copy constructor and no destructor 
 
the object has no virtual member 
 
the object does not use runtime type identification (RTTI)  
 
If any of these conditions is not met then it is usually faster to transfer a pointer or reference 
to the object. If the object is large then it obviously takes time to copy the entire object. Any 
copy constructor must be called when the object is copied to the parameter, and the 
destructor, if any, must be called before the function returns. 
 
The preferred method for transferring composite objects to a function is by a const 
reference. A const reference makes sure that the original object is not modified. Unlike a 
pointer or a non-const reference, a const reference allows the function argument to be an 
expression or an anonymous object. The compiler can easily optimize away a const 
reference if the function is inlined. 
 
An alternative solution is to make the function a member of the object's class or structure. 
This is equally efficient. 
 
Simple function parameters are transferred on the stack in 32-bit systems, but in registers in 
64-bit systems. The latter is more efficient. 64-bit Windows allows a maximum of four 
parameters to be transferred in registers. 64-bit Unix systems allow up to fourteen 
parameters to be transferred in registers (8 float or double plus 6 integer, pointer or 
reference parameters). The this pointer in member functions counts a one parameter. 
Further details are given in manual 5: "Calling conventions for different C++ compilers and 
operating systems". 
 
7.16 Function return types 
The return type of a function should preferably be a simple type, a pointer, a reference, or 
void. Returning objects of a composite type is more complex and often inefficient. 
 


---

 
Objects of a composite type can be returned in registers only in the simplest cases. See 
manual 5: "Calling conventions for different C++ compilers and operating systems" for 
details on when objects can be returned in registers. 
 
Except for the simplest cases, composite objects are returned by copying them into a place 
indicated by the caller through a hidden pointer. The copy constructor, if any, is usually 
called in the copying process, and the destructor is called when the original is destroyed. In 
simple cases, the compiler may be able to avoid the calls to the copy constructor and the 
destructor by constructing the object on its final destination, but don't count on it. 
 
Instead of returning a composite object, you may consider the following alternatives: 
 
 
Make the function a constructor for the object. 
   
 
Make the function modify an existing object rather than making a new one. The 
existing object can be made available to the function through a pointer or reference, 
or the function could be a member of the object's class. 
   
 
Make the function return a pointer or reference to a static object defined inside the 
function. This is efficient, but risky. The returned pointer or reference is valid only 
until the next time the function is called and the local object is overwritten, possibly in 
a different thread. If you forget to make the local object static then it becomes invalid 
as soon as the function returns. 
   
 
Make the function construct an object with new and return a pointer to it. This is 
inefficient because of the costs of dynamic memory allocation. This method also 
involves the risk of memory leaks if you forget to delete the object. 
 
7.17 Function tail calls 
A tail call is a way of optimizing function calls. If the last statement of a function is a call to 
another function, then the compiler can replace the call by a jump to the second function. An 
optimizing compiler will do this automatically. The second function will not return to the first 
function, but directly to the place where the first function was called from. This is more 
efficient because it eliminates a return. Example: 
 
// Example 7.35. Tail call 
void function2(int x); 
 
void function1(int y) { 
  ... 
   function2(y+1); 
} 
 
Here, the return from function1 is eliminated by jumping directly to function2. This 
works even if there is a return value: 
 
// Example 7.36. Tail call with return value 
int function2(int x); 
 
int function1(int y) { 
  ... 
   return function2(y+1); 
} 
 
The tail call optimization works only if the two functions have the same return type. If the 
functions have parameters on the stack (which is mostly the case in 32-bit mode) then the 
two functions must use the same amount of stack space for parameters. 
 


---

 
7.18 Recursive functions 
A recursive function is a function that calls itself. Recursive function calls can be useful for 
handling recursive data structures. The cost of recursive functions is that all parameters and 
local variables get a new instance for every recursion, and this takes up stack space. Deep 
recursions also makes the prediction of return addresses less efficient. This problem 
typically appears with recursion levels deeper than 16 (see the explanation of return stack 
buffer in manual 3: "The microarchitecture of Intel, AMD and VIA CPUs"). 
 
Recursive function calls can still be the most efficient solution for handling a branching data 
tree structure. Recursion is more efficient if the tree structure is broad than if it is deep. A 
non-branching recursion can always be replaced by a loop, which is more efficient. A 
common textbook example of a recursive function is the factorial function: 
 
// Example 7.37. Factorial as recursive function 
unsigned long int factorial(unsigned int n) { 
   if (n < 2) return 1; 
   return n * factorial(n-1); 
} 
 
This implementation is very inefficient because all the instances of n and all the return 
addresses take up storage space on the stack. It is more efficient to use a loop: 
 
// Example 7.38. Factorial function as loop 
unsigned long int factorial(unsigned int n) { 
   unsigned long int product = 1; 
   while (n > 1) { 
      product *= n; 
      n--; 
   } 
   return product; 
} 
 
Recursive tail calls are more efficient than other recursive calls, but still less efficient than a 
loop.  
 
Novice programmers sometimes make a call to main in order to restart their program. This 
is a bad idea because the stack becomes filled up with new instances of all local variables 
for every recursive call to main. The proper way to restart a program is to make a loop in 
main. 
 
7.19 Structures and classes 
Nowadays, programming textbooks recommend object oriented programming as a means 
of making software more clear and modular. The so-called objects are instances of 
structures and classes. The object oriented programming style has both positive and 
negative impacts on program performance. The positive effects are: 
 
 
Variables that are used together are also stored together if they are members of the 
same structure or class. This makes data caching more efficient. 
 
 
Variables that are members of a class need not be passed as parameters to a class 
member function. The overhead of parameter transfer is avoided for these variables. 
 
The negative effects of object oriented programming are: 
 
 
Non-static member functions have a 'this' pointer which is transferred as an implicit 
parameter to the function. The overhead of parameter transfer for 'this' is incurred 


---

 
on all non-static member functions. 
 
 
The 'this' pointer takes up one register. Registers are a scarce resource in 32-bit 
systems. 
 
 
Virtual member functions are less efficient (see page 55). 
 
No general statement can be made about whether the positive or the negative effects of 
object oriented programming are dominating. At least, it can be said that the use of classes 
and member functions is not expensive. You may use an object oriented programming style 
if it is good for the logical structure and clarity of the program as long as you avoid an 
excessive number of function calls in the most critical part of the program. The use of 
structures (without member functions) has no negative effect on performance. 
 
7.20 Class data members (instance variables) 
The data members of a class or structure are stored consecutively in the order in which they 
are declared whenever an instance of the class or structure is created. There is no 
performance penalty for organizing data into classes or structures. Accessing a data 
member of a class or structure object takes no more time than accessing a simple variable. 
 
Most compilers will align data members to round addresses in order to optimize access, as 
given in the following table. 
 
Type 
size, bytes 
alignment, bytes 
bool 
char, signed or unsigned 
short int, signed or unsigned 
int, signed or unsigned 
64-bit integer, signed or unsigned 
pointer or reference, 32-bit mode 
pointer or reference, 64-bit mode 
float 
double 
long double 
8, 10, 12 or 16 
8 or 16 
Table 7.2. Alignment of data members. 
 
This alignment can cause holes of unused bytes in a structure or class with members of 
mixed sizes. For example: 
 
// Example 7.39a 
struct S1 { 
   short int a;  // 2 bytes. first byte at  0, last byte at  1 
                 // 6 unused bytes 
   double b;     // 8 bytes. first byte at  8, last byte at 15 
   int d;        // 4 bytes. first byte at 16, last byte at 19 
                 // 4 unused bytes 
}; 
S1 ArrayOfStructures[100]; 
 
Here, there are 6 unused bytes between a and b because b has to start at an address 
divisible by 8. There are also 4 unused bytes in the end. The reason for this is that the next 
instance of S1 in the array must begin at an address divisible by 8 in order to align its b 
member by 8. The number of unused bytes can be reduced to 2 by putting the smallest 
members last: 
 
// Example 7.39b 


---

 
struct S1 { 
   double b;     // 8 bytes. first byte at  0, last byte at  7 
   int d;        // 4 bytes. first byte at  8, last byte at 11 
   short int a;  // 2 bytes. first byte at 12, last byte at 13 
                 // 2 unused bytes 
}; 
S1 ArrayOfStructures[100]; 
 
This reordering has made the structure 8 bytes smaller and the array 800 bytes smaller. 
 
Structure and class objects can often be made smaller by reordering the data members. If 
the class has at least one virtual member functions then there is a pointer to a virtual table 
before the first data member or after the last member. This pointer is 4 bytes in 32-bit 
systems and 8 bytes in 64-bit systems. If you are in doubt how big a structure or each of its 
members are then you may make some tests with the sizeof operator. The value returned 
by the sizeof operator includes any unused bytes in the end of the object. 
 
The code for accessing a data member is more compact if the offset of the member relative 
to the beginning of the structure or class is less than 128 because the offset can be 
expressed as an 8-bit signed number. If the offset relative to the beginning of the structure 
or class is 128 bytes or more then the offset has to be expressed as a 32-bit number (the 
instruction set has nothing between 8 bit and 32 bit offsets). Example: 
 
// Example 7.40 
class S2 { 
   public: 
   int a[100];  // 400 bytes. first byte at   0, last byte at 399 
   int b;       // 4 bytes.   first byte at 400, last byte at 403 
   int ReadB() {return b;} 
}; 
 
The offset of b is 400 here. Any code that accesses b through a pointer or a member 
function such as ReadB needs to code the offset as a 32-bit number. If a and b are 
swapped then both can be accessed with an offset that is coded as an 8-bit signed number, 
or no offset at all. This makes the code more compact so that the code cache is used more 
efficiently. It is therefore recommended that big arrays and other big objects come last in a 
structure or class declaration and the most often used data members come first. If it is not 
possible to contain all data members within the first 128 bytes then put the most often used 
members in the first 128 bytes. 
 
7.21 Class member functions (methods) 
Each time a new object of a class is declared or created it will generate a new instance of 
the data members. But each member function has only one instance. The function code is 
not copied because the same code can be applied to all instances of the class. 
 
Calling a member function is as fast as calling a simple function with a pointer or reference 
to a structure. For example: 
 
// Example 7.41 
class S3 { 
   public: 
   int a; 
   int b; 
   int Sum1() {return a + b;} 
}; 
int Sum2(S3 * p) {return p->a + p->b;} 
int Sum3(S3 & r) {return  r.a +  r.b;} 
 


---

 
The three functions Sum1, Sum2 and Sum3 are doing exactly the same thing and they are 
equally efficient. If you look at the code generated by the compiler, you will notice that some 
compilers will make exactly identical code for the three functions. Sum1 has an implicit 
'this' pointer which does the same thing as p and r in Sum2 and Sum3. Whether you want 
to make the function a member of the class or give it a pointer or reference to the class or 
structure is simply a matter of programming style. Some compilers make Sum1 slightly more 
efficient than Sum2 and Sum3 in 32-bit Windows by transferring 'this' in a register rather 
than on the stack. 
 
A static member function cannot access any non-static data members or non-static 
member functions. A static member function is faster than a non-static member function 
because it doesn't need the 'this' pointer. You may make member functions faster by 
making them static if they don't need any non-static access. 
 
7.22 Virtual member functions 
Virtual functions are used for implementing polymorphic classes. Each instance of a 
polymorphic class has a pointer to a table of pointers to the different versions of the virtual 
functions. This so-called virtual table is used for finding the right version of the virtual 
function at runtime. Polymorphism is one of the main reasons why object oriented programs 
can be less efficient than non-object oriented programs. If you can avoid virtual functions 
then you can obtain most of the advantages of object oriented programming without paying 
the performance costs. 
 
The time it takes to call a virtual member function is a few clock cycles more than it takes to 
call a non-virtual member function, provided that the function call statement always calls the 
same version of the virtual function. If the version changes then you may get a misprediction 
penalty of 10 - 20 clock cycles. The rules for prediction and misprediction of virtual function 
calls is the same as for switch statements, as explained on page 44. 
 
The dispatching mechanism can be bypassed when the virtual function is called on an 
object of known type, but you cannot always rely on the compiler bypassing the dispatch 
mechanism even when it would be obvious to do so. See page 74. 
 
Runtime polymorphism is needed only if it cannot be known at compile time which version 
of a polymorphic member function is called. If virtual functions are used in a critical part of a 
program then you may consider whether it is possible to obtain the desired functionality 
without polymorphism or with compile-time polymorphism. 
 
It is sometimes possible to obtain the desired polymorphism effect with templates instead of 
virtual functions. The template parameter should be a class containing the functions that 
have multiple versions. This method is faster because the template parameter is always 
resolved at compile time rather than at runtime. Example 7.47 on page 59 shows an 
example of how to do this. Unfortunately, the syntax is so kludgy that it may not be worth 
the effort. 
 
7.23 Runtime type identification (RTTI) 
Runtime type identification adds extra information to all class objects and is not efficient. If 
the compiler has an option for RTTI then turn it off and use alternative implementations. 
 
7.24 Inheritance 
An object of a derived class is implemented in the same way as an object of a simple class 
containing the members of both parent and child class. Members of parent and child class 


---

 
are accessed equally fast. In general, you can assume that there is hardly any performance 
penalty to using inheritance. 
 
There may be a slight degradation in code caching for the following reasons: 
 
 
The size of the parent class data members is added to the offset of the child class 
members. The code that accesses data members with a total offset bigger than 127 
bytes is slightly less compact. See page 54. 
 
 
The member functions of parent and child are typically stored in different modules. 
This may cause a lot of jumping around and less efficient code caching. This 
problem can be solved by making sure that functions which are called near each 
other are also stored near each other. See page 89 for details. 
 
Inheritance from multiple parent classes in the same generation can cause complications 
with member pointers and virtual functions or when accessing an object of a derived class 
through a pointer to one of the base classes. You may avoid multiple inheritance by making 
objects inside the derived class:  
 
// Example 7.42a. Multiple inheritance 
class B1; class B2; 
class D : public B1, public B2 { 
public: 
   int c; 
}; 
 
Replace with: 
 
// Example 7.42b. Alternative to multiple inheritance 
class B1; class B2; 
class D : public B1 { 
public: 
   B2 b2; 
   int c; 
}; 
 
7.25 Constructors and destructors 
A constructor is implemented internally as a member function which returns a reference to 
the object. The allocation of memory for a new object is not necessarily done by the 
constructor itself. Constructors are therefore as efficient as any other member functions. 
This applies to default constructors, copy constructors, and any other constructors. 
 
A class doesn't need a constructor. A default constructor is not needed if the object doesn't 
need initialization. A copy constructor is not needed if the object can be copied simply by 
copying all data members. A simple constructor may be inlined for improved performance. 
 
A copy constructor may be called whenever an object is copied by assignment, as a 
function parameter, or as a function return value. The copy constructor can be a time 
consumer if it involves allocation of memory or other resources. There are various ways to 
avoid this wasteful copying of memory blocks, for example: 
 
Use a reference or pointer to the object instead of copying it 
 
Use a "move constructor" to transfer ownership of the memory block. This requires a 
compiler with C++0x support. 
 
Make a member function or friend function or operator that transfers ownership of 
the memory block from one object to another. The object that looses ownership of 
the memory block should have its pointer set to NULL. There should of course be a 
destructor that destroys any memory block that the object owns. 
 


---

 
A destructor is as efficient as a member function. Do not make a destructor if it is not 
necessary. A virtual destructor is as efficient as a virtual member function. See page 55. 
 
7.26 Unions 
A union is a structure where data members share the same memory space. A union can be 
used for saving memory space by allowing two data members that are never used at the 
same time to share the same piece of memory. See page 91 for an example. 
 
A union can also be used for accessing the same data in different ways. Example: 
 
// Example 7.43 
union { 
   float f; 
   int i; 
} x; 
x.f = 2.0f; 
x.i |= 0x80000000;  // set sign bit of f 
cout << x.f;        // will give -2.0 
 
In this example, the sign bit of f is set by using the bitwise OR operator, which can only be 
applied to integers. 
 
7.27 Bitfields 
Bitfields may be useful for making data more compact. Accessing a member of a bitfield is 
less efficient than accessing a member of a structure. The extra time may be justified in 
case of large arrays if it can save cache space or make files smaller. 
 
It is faster to compose a bitfield by the use of << and | operations than to write the 
members individually. Example: 
 
// Example 7.44a 
struct Bitfield { 
   int a:4; 
   int b:2; 
   int c:2; 
}; 
Bitfield x; 
int A, B, C; 
x.a = A; 
x.b = B; 
x.c = C; 
 
Assuming that the values of A, B and C are too small to cause overflow, this code can be 
improved in the following way: 
 
// Example 7.44b 
union Bitfield { 
   struct { 
      int a:4; 
      int b:2; 
      int c:2; 
   }; 
   char abc; 
}; 
Bitfield x; 
int A, B, C; 
x.abc = A | (B << 4) | (C << 6); 
 


---

 
Or, if protection against overflow is needed: 
 
// Example 7.44c 
x.abc = (A & 0x0F) | ((B & 3) << 4) | ((C & 3) <<6 ); 
 
7.28 Overloaded functions 
The different versions of an overloaded function are simply treated as different functions. 
There is no performance penalty for using overloaded functions. 
 
7.29 Overloaded operators 
An overloaded operator is equivalent to a function. Using an overloaded operator is exactly 
as efficient as using a function that does the same thing. 
 
An expression with multiple overloaded operators will cause the creation of temporary 
objects for intermediate results, which may be undesired. Example: 
 
// Example 7.45a 
class vector {                                // 2-dimensional vector 
public: 
   float x, y;                                // x,y coordinates 
   vector() {}                                // default constructor 
   vector(float a, float b) {x = a; y = b;}   // constructor 
   vector operator + (vector const & a) {     // sum operator 
      return vector(x + a.x, y + a.y);}       // add elements 
}; 
 
vector a, b, c, d; 
a = b + c + d;         // makes intermediate object for (b + c) 
 
The creation of a temporary object for the intermediate result (b+c) can be avoided by 
joining the operations: 
 
// Example 7.45b 
a.x = b.x + c.x + d.x; 
a.y = b.y + c.y + d.y; 
 
Fortunately, most compilers will do this optimization automatically in simple cases. 
 
7.30 Templates 
A template is similar to a macro in the sense that the template parameters are replaced by 
their values before compilation. The following example illustrates the difference between a 
function parameter and a template parameter: 
 
// Example 7.46 
int Multiply (int x, int m) { 
   return x * m;} 
 
template <int m> 
int MultiplyBy (int x) { 
   return x * m;} 
 
int a, b; 
a = Multiply(10,8); 
b = MultiplyBy<8>(10); 
 
a and b will both get the value 10 * 8 = 80. The difference lies in the way m is transferred to 
the function. In the simple function, m is transferred at runtime from the caller to the called 


---

 
function. But in the template function, m is replaced by its value at compile time so that the 
compiler sees the constant 8 rather than the variable m. The advantage of using a template 
parameter rather than a function parameter is that the overhead of parameter transfer is 
avoided. The disadvantage is that the compiler needs to make a new instance of the 
template function for each different value of the template parameter. If MultiplyBy in this 
example is called with many different factors as template parameters then the code can 
become very big. 
 
In the above example, the template function is faster than the simple function because the 
compiler knows that it can multiply by a power of 2 by using a shift operation. x*8 is 
replaced by x<<3, which is faster. In the case of the simple function, the compiler doesn't 
know the value of m and therefore cannot do the optimization unless the function can be 
inlined. (In the above example, the compiler is able to inline and optimize both functions and 
simply put 80 into a and b. But in more complex cases it might not be able to do so). 
 
A template parameter can also be a type. The example on page 39 shows how you can 
make arrays of different types with the same template. 
 
Templates are efficient because the template parameters are always resolved at compile 
time. Templates make the source code more complex, but not the compiled code. In 
general, there is no cost in terms of execution speed to using templates. 
 
Two or more template instances will be joined into one if the template parameters are 
exactly the same. If the template parameters differ then you will get one instance for each 
set of template parameters. A template with many instances makes the compiled code big 
and uses more cache space. 
 
Excessive use of templates makes the code difficult to read. If a template has only one 
instance then you may as well use a #define, const or typedef instead of a template 
parameter. 
 
Templates may be used for metaprogramming, as explained at page 154. 
Using templates for polymorphism 
A template class can be used for implementing a compile-time polymorphism, which is more 
efficient than the runtime polymorphism that is obtained with virtual member functions. The 
following example shows first the runtime polymorphism: 
 
// Example 7.47a. Runtime polymorphism with virtual functions 
class CHello { 
public: 
   void NotPolymorphic();    // Non-polymorphic functions go here 
   virtual void Disp();      // Virtual function 
   void Hello() { 
      cout << "Hello "; 
      Disp();                // Call to virtual function 
   } 
}; 
 
class C1 : public CHello { 
   public: 
   virtual void Disp() { 
      cout << 1; 
   } 
}; 
 
class C2 : public CHello { 
   public: 
   virtual void Disp() { 


---

 
      cout << 2; 
   } 
}; 
 
void test () { 
   C1 Object1;  C2 Object2; 
   CHello * p; 
   p = &Object1; 
   p->NotPolymorphic();      // Called directly 
   p->Hello();               // Writes "Hello 1" 
   p = &Object2; 
   p->Hello();               // Writes "Hello 2" 
} 
 
The dispatching to C1::Disp() or C2::Disp() is done at runtime here if the compiler 
doesn't know what class of object p points to (see page 74). Current compilers are not very 
good at optimizing away p and inlining the call to Object1.Hello(), though future 
compilers may be able to do so. 
 
If it is known at compile-time whether the object belongs to class C1 or C2, then we can 
avoid the inefficient virtual function dispatch process. This can be done with a special trick 
which is used in the Active Template Library (ATL) and Windows Template Library (WTL): 
 
// Example 7.47b. Compile-time polymorphism with templates 
 
// Place non-polymorphic functions in the grandparent class: 
class CGrandParent { 
public: 
   void NotPolymorphic(); 
}; 
 
// Any function that needs to call a polymorphic function goes in the 
// parent class. The child class is given as a template parameter: 
template <typename MyChild> 
class CParent : public CGrandParent { 
public: 
   void Hello() { 
      cout << "Hello "; 
      // call polymorphic child function: 
      (static_cast<MyChild*>(this))->Disp(); 
   } 
}; 
 
// The child classes implement the functions that have multiple 
// versions: 
class CChild1 : public CParent<CChild1> { 
   public: 
   void Disp() { 
      cout << 1; 
   } 
}; 
 
class CChild2 : public CParent<CChild2> { 
   public: 
   void Disp() { 
      cout << 2; 
   } 
}; 
 
void test () { 
   CChild1 Object1;  CChild2 Object2; 
   CChild1 * p1; 
   p1 = &Object1; 


---

 
   p1->Hello();              // Writes "Hello 1" 
   CChild2 * p2; 
   p2 = &Object2; 
   p2->Hello();              // Writes "Hello 2" 
} 
 
Here CParent is a template class which gets information about its child class through a 
template parameter. It can call the polymorphic member of its child class by type-casting its 
'this' pointer to a pointer to its child class. This is only safe if it has the correct child class 
name as template parameter. In other words, you must make sure that the declaration 
 
class CChild1 : public CParent<CChild1> { 
 
has the same name for the child class name and the template parameter. 
 
The order of inheritance is now as follows. The first generation class (CGrandParent) 
contains any non-polymorphic member functions. The second generation class 
(CParent<>) contains any member functions that need to call a polymorphic function. The 
third generations classes contain the different versions of the polymorphic functions. The 
second generation class gets information about the third generation class through a 
template parameter. 
 
No time is wasted on runtime dispatch to virtual member functions if the class of the object 
is known. This information is contained in p1 and p2 having different types. A disadvantage 
is that CParent::Hello() has multiple instances that take up cache space. 
 
The syntax in example 7.47b is admittedly very kludgy. The few clock cycles that we may 
save by avoiding the virtual function dispatch mechanism is rarely enough to justify such a 
complicated code that is difficult to understand and therefore difficult to maintain. If the 
compiler is able to do the devirtualization (see page 74) automatically then it is certainly 
more convenient to rely on compiler optimization than to use this complicated template 
method. 
 
7.31 Threads 
Threads are used for doing two or more jobs simultaneously or seemingly simultaneously. If 
the computer has only one CPU core then it is not possible to do two jobs simultaneously. 
Each thread will get time slices of typically 30 ms for foreground jobs and 10 ms for 
background jobs. The context switches after each time slice are quite costly because all 
caches have to adapt to the new context. It is possible to reduce the number of context 
switches by making longer time slices. This will make applications run faster at the cost of 
longer response times for user input. (In Windows you can increase the time slices to 120 
ms by selecting optimize performance for background services under advanced system 
performance options. I don't know if this is possible in Linux). 
 
Threads are useful for assigning different priorities to different tasks. For example, in a word 
processor the user expects an immediate response to pressing a key or moving the mouse. 
This task must have a high priority. Other tasks such as spell-checking and repagination are 
running in other threads with lower priority. If the different tasks were not divided into 
threads with different priorities then the user might experience unacceptably long response 
times to keyboard and mouse inputs when the program is busy doing the spell checking. 
 
Any task that takes a long time, such as heavy mathematical calculations, should be 
scheduled in a separate thread if the application has a graphical user interface. Otherwise 
the program will be unable to respond quickly to keyboard or mouse input. 
 
It is possible to make a thread-like scheduling in an application program without invoking the 
overhead of the operating system thread scheduler. This can be accomplished by doing the 


---

 
heavy background calculations piece by piece in a function that is called from the message 
loop of a graphical user interface (OnIdle in Windows MFC). This method may be faster 
than making a separate thread in systems with only one CPU core, but it requires that the 
background job can be divided into small pieces of a suitable duration. 
 
The best way to fully utilize systems with multiple CPU cores is to divide the job into multiple 
threads. Each thread can then run on its own CPU core. 
 
There are four kinds of costs to multithreading that we have to take into account when 
optimizing multithreaded applications: 
 
 
The cost of starting and stopping threads. Don't put a task into a separate thread if it 
is short in duration compared with the time it takes to start and stop the thread. 
 
 
The cost of task switching. This cost is minimized if the number of threads with the 
same priority is no more than the number of CPU cores. 
 
 
The cost of synchronizing and communicating between threads. The overhead of 
semaphores, mutexes, etc. is considerable. If two threads are often waiting for each 
other in order to get access to the same resource then it may be better to join them 
into one thread. A variable that is shared between multiple threads must be declared 
volatile. This prevents the compiler from doing optimizations on that variable. 
 
 
The different threads need separate storage. No function or class that is used by 
multiple threads should rely on static or global variables. (See thread-local storage p. 
28) The threads have each their stack. This can cause cache contentions if the 
threads share the same cache. 
 
Multithreaded programs must use thread-safe functions. A thread-safe function should 
never use static variables. 
 
See chapter 10 page 102 for further discussion of the techniques of multithreading. 
 
7.32 Exceptions and error handling 
Exception handling is intended for detecting errors that seldom occur and recovering from 
error conditions in a graceful way. You may think that exception handling takes no extra 
time as long as the error doesn't occur, but unfortunately this is not always true. The 
program may have to do a lot of bookkeeping in order to know how to recover in the event 
of an exception. The costs of this bookkeeping depends very much on the compiler. Some 
compilers have efficient table-based methods with little or no overhead while other 
compilers have inefficient code-based methods or require runtime type identification (RTTI), 
which affects other parts of the code. See ISO/IEC TR18015 Technical Report on C++ 
Performance for further explanation. 
 
The following example explains why bookkeeping is needed: 
 
// Example 7.48 
class C1 { 
   public: 
   ... 
   ~C1(); 
}; 
 
void F1() { 
   C1 x; 
   ... 
} 


---

 
 
void F0() {    
   try { 
      F1(); 
   } 
   catch (...) { 
   ... 
   } 
} 
 
The function F1 is supposed to call the destructor for the object x when it returns. But what 
if an exception occurs somewhere in F1? Then we are breaking out of F1 without returning. 
F1 is prevented from cleaning up because it has been brutally interrupted. Now it is the 
responsibility of the exception handler to call the destructor of x. This is only possible if F1 
has saved all information about the destructor to call or any other cleanup that may be 
necessary. If F1 calls another function which in turn calls another function, etc., and if an 
exception occurs in the innermost function, then the exception handler needs all information 
about the chain of function calls and it needs to follow the track backwards though the 
function calls to check for all the necessary cleanup jobs to do. This is called stack 
unwinding. 
 
All functions have to save some information for the exception handler, even if no exception 
ever happens. This is the reason why exception handling can be expensive in some 
compilers. If exception handling is not necessary for your application then you should 
disable it in order to make the code smaller and more efficient. You can disable exception 
handling for the whole program by turning off the exception handling option in the compiler. 
You can disable exception handling for a single function by adding throw() to the function 
prototype: 
 
void F1() throw(); 
 
This allows the compiler to assume that F1 will never throw any exception so that it doesn't 
have to save recovery information for function F1. However, if F1 calls another function F2 
that can possibly throw an exception then F1 has to check for exceptions thrown by F2 and 
call the std::unexpected() function in case F2 actually throws an exception. Therefore, 
you should apply the empty throw() specification to F1 only if all functions called by F1 
also have an empty throw() specification. The empty throw()specification is useful for 
library functions. 
 
The compiler makes a distinction between leaf functions and frame functions. A frame 
function is a function that calls at least one other function. A leaf function is a function that 
doesn't call any other function. A leaf function is simpler than a frame function because the 
stack unwinding information can be left out if exceptions can be ruled out or if there is 
nothing to clean up in case of an exception. A frame function can be turned into a leaf 
function by inlining all the functions that it calls. The best performance is obtained if the 
critical innermost loop of a program contains no calls to frame functions. 
 
While an empty throw() statement can improve optimizations in some cases, there is no 
reason to add statements like throw(A,B,C) to tell explicitly what kind of exceptions a 
function can throw. In fact, the compiler may actually add extra code to check that thrown 
exceptions are indeed of the specified types (See Sutter: A Pragmatic Look at Exception 
Specifications, Dr Dobbs Journal, 2002). 
 
In some cases, it is optimal to use exception handling even in the most critical part of a 
program. This is the case if alternative implementations are less efficient and you want to be 
able to recover from errors. The following example illustrates such a case: 
 
// Example 7.49 


---

 
// Portability note: This example is specific to Microsoft compilers. 
// It will look different in other compilers. 
#include <excpt.h> 
#include <float.h> 
#include <math.h> 
#define EXCEPTION_FLT_OVERFLOW  0xC0000091L 
 
void MathLoop() { 
   const int arraysize = 1000;  unsigned int dummy; 
  double  a[arraysize], b[arraysize], c[arraysize]; 
 
   // Enable exception for floating point overflow: 
  _controlfp_s(&dummy, 0, _EM_OVERFLOW);  
   // _controlfp(0, _EM_OVERFLOW); // if above line doesn't work 
  
  int i = 0;   // Initialize loop counter outside both loops 
   // The purpose of the while loop is to resume after exceptions: 
   while (i < arraysize) { 
      // Catch exceptions in this block: 
 
 
      __try { 
         // Main loop for calculations: 
        for ( ; i < arraysize; i++) { 
 
            // Overflow may occur in multiplication here: 
            a[i] = log (b[i] * c[i]); 
         } 
      } 
      // Catch floating point overflow but no other exceptions: 
      __except (GetExceptionCode() == EXCEPTION_FLT_OVERFLOW 
      ? EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER : EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH) { 
         // Floating point overflow has occurred. 
         // Reset floating point status: 
         _fpreset(); 
         _controlfp_s(&dummy, 0, _EM_OVERFLOW);  
         // _controlfp(0, _EM_OVERFLOW); // if above doesn't work 
 
         // Re-do the calculation in a way that avoids overflow: 
         a[i] = log(b[i]) + log(c[i]); 
 
         // Increment loop counter and go back into the for-loop: 
         i++; 
      } 
   } 
} 
 
Assume that the numbers in b[i] and c[i] are so big that overflow can occur in the 
multiplication b[i]*c[i], though this only happens rarely. The above code will catch an 
exception in case of overflow and redo the calculation in a way that takes more time but 
avoids the overflow. Taking the logarithm of each factor rather than the product makes sure 
that no overflow can occur, but the calculation time is doubled. 
 
The time it takes to make support for the exception handling is negligible because there is 
no try block or function call (other than log) inside the critical innermost loop. log is a 
library function which we assume is optimized. We cannot change its possible exception 
handling support anyway. The exception is costly when it occurs, but this is not a problem 
since we are assuming that the occurrence is rare. 
 
Testing for the overflow condition inside the loop does not cost anything here because we 
are relying on the microprocessor hardware for raising an exception in case of overflow. The 
exception is caught by the operating system which redirects it to the exception handler in 
the program if there is a try block. 
 


---

 
There is a portability issue to catching hardware exceptions. The mechanism relies on non-
standardized details in both compiler, operating system and CPU hardware. Porting such an 
application to a different platform is likely to require modifications in the code. 
 
Let's look at the possible alternatives to exception handling in this example. We might check 
for overflow by checking if b[i] and c[i] are too big before multiplying them. This would 
require two floating point comparisons, which are relatively costly because they must be 
inside the innermost loop. Another possibility is to always use the safe formula a[i] = 
log(b[i]) + log(c[i]);. This would double the number of calls to log, and 
logarithms take a long time to calculate. If there is a way to check for overflow outside the 
loop without checking all the array elements then this might be a better solution. It might be 
possible to do such a check before the loop if all the factors are generated from the same 
few parameters. Or it might be possible to do the check after the loop if the results are 
combined by some formula into a single result. An uncaught overflow condition will generate 
the value infinity, and this value will propagate through the calculations so that the final 
result will be infinity or NAN (Not A Number) if an overflow or another error has occurred 
anywhere in the calculations. The program can check the final result to see if it is a valid 
number (e.g. with _finite()) and redo the calculations in a safe way in case of error. The 
calculations may take more time than normal on some microprocessors when an operand is 
infinity or NAN. 
Avoiding the cost of exception handling 
Exception handling is not necessary when no attempt is made to recover from errors. If you 
just want the program to issue an error message and stop the program in case of an error 
then there is no reason to use try, catch, and throw. It is more efficient to define your 
own error-handling function that simply prints an appropriate error message and then calls 
exit. 
 
Calling exit may not be safe if there are allocated resources that need to be cleaned up, 
as explained below. There are other possible ways of handling errors without using 
exceptions. The function that detects an error can return with an error code which the calling 
function can use for recovering or for issuing an error message.  
 
It is recommended to use a systematic and well thought-through approach to error handling. 
You have to distinguish between recoverable and non-recoverable errors; make sure 
allocated resources are cleaned up in case of an error; and make appropriate error 
messages to the user. 
Making exception-safe code 
Assume that a function opens a file in exclusive mode, and an error condition terminates the 
program before the file is closed. The file will remain locked after the program is terminated 
and the user will be unable to access the file until the computer is rebooted. To prevent this 
kind of problems you must make your program exception safe. In other words, the program 
must clean up everything in case of an exception or other error condition. Things that may 
need to be cleaned up include: 
 
 
Memory allocated with new or malloc. 
   
 
Handles to windows, graphic brushes, etc. 
   
 
Locked mutexes. 
   
 
Open database connections. 
   
 
Open files and network connections. 
   


---

 
 
Temporary files that need to be deleted. 
   
 
User work that needs to be saved. 
   
 
Any other allocated resource. 
 
The C++ way of handling cleanup jobs is to make a destructor. A function that reads or 
writes a file can be wrapped into a class with a destructor that makes sure the file is closed. 
The same method can be used for any other resource, such as dynamically allocated 
memory, windows, mutexes, database connections, etc. 
 
The C++ exception handling system makes sure that all destructors for local objects are 
called. The program is exception safe if there are wrapper classes with destructors to take 
care of all cleanup of allocated resources. The system is likely to fail if the destructor causes 
another exception. 
 
If you make your own error handling system instead of using exception handling then you 
cannot be sure that all destructors are called and resources cleaned up. If an error handler 
calls exit(), abort(), _endthread(), etc. then there is no guarantee that all 
destructors are called. The safe way to handle an unrecoverable error without using 
exceptions is to return from the function. The function may return an error code if possible, 
or the error code may be stored in a global object. The calling function must then check for 
the error code. If the latter function also has something to clean up then it must return to its 
own caller, and so on. 
 
7.33 Other cases of stack unwinding 
The preceding paragraph described a mechanism called stack unwinding that is used by 
exception handlers for cleaning up and calling any necessary destructors after jumping out 
of a function in case of an exception without using the normal return route. This mechanism 
is also used in two other situations: 
 
The stack unwinding mechanism may be used when a thread is terminated. The purpose is 
to detect if any objects declared in the thread have a destructor that needs to be called. It is 
recommended to return from functions that require cleanup before terminating a thread. You 
cannot be certain that a call to _endthread() cleans up the stack. This behaviour is 
implementation dependent. 
 
The stack unwinding mechanism is also used when the function longjmp is used for 
jumping out of a function. Avoid the use of longjmp if possible. Don't rely on longjmp in 
time-critical code. 
 
7.34 Preprocessing directives 
Preprocessing directives (everything that begins with #) are costless in terms of program 
performance because they are resolved before the program is compiled. 
 
#if directives are useful for supporting multiple platforms or multiple configurations with the 
same source code. #if is more efficient than if because #if is resolved at compile time 
while if is resolved at runtime. 
 
#define directives are equivalent to const definitions when used for defining constants. 
For example, #define ABC 123 and const int ABC = 123; are equally efficient 
because, in most cases, an optimizing compiler can replace an integer constant with its 
value. However, the const int declaration may in some cases take memory space
