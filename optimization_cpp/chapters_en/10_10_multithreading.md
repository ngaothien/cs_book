matrices, clock cycles per element. 
 
As table 9.3 shows, the method of storing data without caching is advantageous if, and only 
if, a level-2 cache miss can be expected. The 6464 matrix size causes misses in the level-
1 cache. This has hardly any effect on the total execution time because the cache miss on a 
store operation doesn't delay the subsequent instructions. The 512512 matrix size causes 
misses in the level-2 cache. This has a very dramatic effect on the execution time because 
the memory bus is saturated. This can be ameliorated by using nontemporal writes. If the 
cache contentions can be prevented in other ways, as explained in chapter 9.10, then the 
nontemporal write instructions are not optimal. 
 
There are certain restrictions on using the instructions listed in table 9.2. All these 
instructions require that the microprocessor has the SSE or SSE2 instruction set, as listed in 
the table. The 16-byte instructions MOVNTPS, MOVNTPD and MOVNTDQ require that the 
operating system has support for XMM registers; see page 125.  
 
The Intel compiler can insert nontemporal writes automatically in vectorized code when the  
#pragma vector nontemporal is used. However, this does not work in example  9.6b. 
 
The MOVNTQ instruction must be followed by an EMMS instruction before any floating point 
instructions. This is coded as _mm_empty() as shown in example 9.6b. The MOVNTQ 
instruction cannot be used in 64-bit device drivers for Windows. 
 
 
10 Multithreading 
The clock frequency of the CPU is limited by physical factors. The way to increase the 
throughput of CPU-intensive programs when the clock frequency is limited is to do multiple 
things at the same time. There are three ways to do things in parallel: 
 
 
Using multiple CPUs or multi-core CPUs, as described in this chapter. 
 
 
Using the out-of-order capabilities of modern CPUs, as described in chapter 11. 
 
 
Using the vector operations of modern CPUs, as described in chapter 12. 
 
Most modern CPUs have two or more cores, and it can be expected that the number of 
cores will grow in the future. To use multiple CPUs or CPU cores, we need to divide the 
work into multiple threads. There are two main principles here: functional decomposition 
and data decomposition. Functional decomposition here means that different threads are 
doing different kinds of jobs. For example, one tread can take care of the user interface, 
another thread can take care of communication with a remote database, and a third thread 
can do mathematical calculations. It is important that the user interface is not in the same 
thread as very time-consuming tasks because this would give annoyingly long and irregular 
response times. It is often useful to put time-consuming tasks into separate threads with low 
priority.

In many cases, however, there is a single task that consumes most of the resources. In this 
case we need to split up the data into multiple blocks in order to utilize the multiple 
processor cores. Each thread should then handle its own block of data. This is data 
decomposition. 
 
It is important to distinguish between coarse-grained parallelism and fine-grained parallelism 
when deciding whether it is advantageous to do things in parallel. Coarse-grained 
parallelism refers to the situation where a long sequence of operations can be carried out 
independently of other tasks that are running in parallel. Fine-grained parallelism is the 
situation where a task is divided into many small subtasks, but it is impossible to work for 
very long on a particular subtask before coordination with other subtasks is necessary. 
 
Multithreading works more efficiently with coarse-grained parallelism than with fine-grained 
parallelism because communication and synchronization between the different cores is 
slow. If the granularity is too fine then it is not advantageous to split the tasks into multiple 
threads. Out-of-order execution (chapter  11) and vector operations (chapter 12) are more 
useful methods for exploiting fine-grained parallelism. 
 
The way to use multiple CPU cores is to divide the work into multiple threads. The use of 
threads is discussed on page 61. In the case of data decomposition, we should preferably 
have no more threads with the same priority than the number of cores or logical processors 
available in the system. The number of logical processors available can be determined by a 
system call (e.g. GetProcessAffinityMask in Windows). 
 
There are several ways to divide the workload between multiple CPU cores: 
 
 
Define multiple threads and put an equal amount of work into each thread. This 
method works with all compilers. 
 
 
Use automatic parallelization. The Gnu, Intel and PathScale compilers can 
automatically detect opportunities for parallelization in the code and divide it into 
multiple threads, but the compiler may not be able to find the optimal decomposition 
of the data. 
 
 
Use OpenMP directives. OpenMP is a standard for specifying parallel processing in 
C++ and Fortran. These directives are supported by Microsoft, Intel, PathScale and 
Gnu compilers. See www.openmp.org and the compiler manual for details. 
 
 
Use function libraries with internal multi-threading, e.g. Intel Math Kernel Library. 
 
The multiple CPU cores or logical processors usually share the same cache, at least at the 
last cache level, and in some cases even the same level-1 cache. The advantage of sharing 
the same cache is that communication between threads becomes faster and that threads 
can share the same code and read-only data. The disadvantage is that the cache will be 
filled up if the threads use different memory areas, and there will be cache contentions if the 
threads write to the same memory areas. 
 
Data that are read-only can be shared between multiple threads, while data that are 
modified should be separate for each thread. It is not good to have two or more threads 
writing to the same cache line, because the threads will invalidate each other's caches and 
cause large delays. The easiest way to make thread-specific data is to declare it locally in 
the thread function so that it is stored on the stack. Each thread has its own stack. 
Alternatively, you may define a structure or class for containing thread-specific data and 
make one instance for each thread. This structure or class should be aligned by at least the 
cache line size in order to avoid multiple threads writing to the same cache line. The cache

line size is typically 64 bytes on contemporary processors. The cache line size may possibly 
be more (128 or 256 bytes) on future processors. 
 
There are various methods for communication and synchronization between threads, such 
as semaphores, mutexes and message systems. All of these methods are time consuming. 
Therefore, the data and resources should be organized so that the amount of necessary 
communication between threads is minimized. For example, if multiple threads are sharing 
the same queue, list, database, or other data structure then you may consider if it is 
possible to give each thread its own data structure and then merge the multiple data 
structures in the end when all threads have finished the time-consuming data processing. 
 
Running multiple threads on a system with only one logical processor is not an advantage if 
the threads are competing for the same resources. But it can be a good idea to put time-
consuming calculations into a separate thread with lower priority than the user interface. It is 
also useful to put file access and network access in separate threads so that one thread can 
do calculations while another thread is waiting for response from a hard disk or network. 
 
Various development tools for supporting multi-threaded software are available from Intel.

10.1 Simultaneous multithreading 
Many microprocessors are able to run two threads in each core. For example, a processor 
with four cores can run eight threads simultaneously. This processor has four physical 
processors but eight logical processors. 
 
"Hyperthreading" is Intel's term for simultaneous multithreading. Two threads running in the 
same core will always compete for the same resources, such as cache and execution units. 
If any of the shared resources are limiting factors for the performance then there is no 
advantage to using simultaneous multithreading. On the contrary, each thread may run at 
less than half speed because of cache evictions and other resource conflicts. But if a large 
fraction of the time goes to cache misses, branch misprediction, or long dependency chains, 
then each thread will run at more than half the single-thread speed. In this case there is an 
advantage to using simultaneous multithreading, but the performance is not doubled. A 
thread that shares the resources of the core with another thread will always run slower than 
a thread that runs alone in the core. 
 
It is often necessary to do experiments in order to determine whether it is advantageous to 
use simultaneous multithreading or not in a particular application. 
 
If simultaneous multithreading is not advantageous then it is necessary to query certain 
operating system functions (e.g. GetLogicalProcessorInformation in Windows) to 
determine if the processor has simultaneous multithreading. If so, then you can avoid 
simultaneous multithreading by using only the even-numbered logical processors (0, 2, 4, 
etc.). Older operating systems lack the necessary functions for distinguishing between the 
number of physical processors and the number of logical processors. 
 
There is no way to tell the processor to give higher priority to one thread than another. 
Therefore, it can often happen that a low-priority thread steals resources from a higher-
priority thread running in the same core. It is the responsibility of the operating system to 
avoid running two threads with widely different priority in the same processor core. 
Unfortunately, contemporary operating are not able to handle this problem adequately. 
 
The Intel compiler is capable of making two threads where one thread is used for 
prefetching data for the other thread. However, in most cases automatic hardware 
prefetching is more efficient than software prefetching.
