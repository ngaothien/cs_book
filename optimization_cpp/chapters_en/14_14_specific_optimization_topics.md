# 14 Specific optimization topics

 
 
If you are using an Intel compiler, then make sure the startup code and main() are 
compiled without any option that limits the CPU brand. Critical parts of the code can then be 
placed in a separate C or C++ file and compiled for the desired instruction set. If the CPU 
brand check is bypassed by any of these methods then the critical part can run optimally on 
any brand of CPU. 
 
These methods also work when Intel libraries are used with other compilers. This includes 
the libraries named MKL, VML and SVML. The IPP library does not need any patch. 
 
Note that these methods are based on my own research, not on publicly available 
information. They have worked well in tests on Intel compiler versions 7 through 14, with 
some changes for each version. The examples are intended to work in both Windows and 
Linux, 32-bit and 64-bit. They have not been tested in Mac systems. 
 
 
14 Specific optimization topics 
14.1 Use lookup tables 
Reading a value from a table of constants is very fast if the table is cached. Usually it takes 
only a few clock cycles to read from a table in the level-1 cache. We can take advantage of 
this fact by replacing a function call with a table lookup if the function has only a limited 
number of possible inputs. 
 
Let's take the integer factorial function (n!) as an example. The only allowed inputs are the 
integers from 0 to 12. Higher inputs give overflow and negative inputs give infinity. A typical 
implementation of the factorial function looks like this: 
 
// Example 14.1a 
int factorial (int n) {          // n! 
   int i, f = 1; 
   for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) f *= i; 
   return f; 
} 
 
This calculation requires n-1 multiplications, which can take quite a long time. It is more 
efficient to use a lookup table: 
 
// Example 14.1b 
int factorial (int n) {          // n! 
   // Table of factorials: 
   const int FactorialTable[13] = {1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720,  
      5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800, 39916800, 479001600}; 
   if ((unsigned int)n < 13) {   // Bounds checking (see page 137) 
      return FactorialTable[n];  // Table lookup 
   } 
   else { 
      return 0;                  // return 0 if out of range 
   } 
} 
 
This implementation uses a lookup table instead of calculating the value each time the 
function is called. I have added a bounds check on n here because the consequence of n 
being out of range is possibly more serious when n is an array index than when n is a loop 
count. The method of bounds checking is explained below on page 137. 
 


---

 
The table should be declared const in order to enable constant propagation and other 
optimizations. You may declare the function inline. 
 
Replacing a function with a lookup table is advantageous in most cases where the number 
of possible inputs is limited and there are no cache problems. It is not advantageous to use 
a lookup table if you expect the table to be evicted from the cache between each call, and 
the time it takes to calculate the function is less than the time it takes to reload the value 
from memory plus the costs to other parts of the program of occupying a cache line. 
 
Table lookup cannot be vectorized with the current instruction set. Do not use lookup tables 
if this prevents a faster vectorized code. 
 
Storing something in static memory can cause caching problems because static data are 
likely to be scattered around at different memory addresses. If caching is a problem then it 
may be useful to copy the table from static memory to stack memory outside the innermost 
loop. This is done by declaring the table inside a function but outside the innermost loop and 
without the static keyword: 
 
// Example 14.1c 
void CriticalInnerFunction () { 
   // Table of factorials: 
   const int FactorialTable[13] = {1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720,  
      5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800, 39916800, 479001600}; 
   ... 
   int i, a, b; 
   // Critical innermost loop: 
   for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { 
      ... 
      a = FactorialTable[b]; 
      ... 
   } 
} 
 
The FactorialTable in example 14.1c is copied from static memory to the stack when 
CriticalInnerFunction is called. The compiler will store the table in static memory and 
insert a code that copies the table to stack memory at the start of the function. Copying the 
table takes extra time, of course, but this is permissible when it is outside the critical 
innermost loop. The loop will use the copy of the table that is stored in stack memory which 
is contiguous with other local variables and therefore likely to be cached more efficiently 
than static memory. 
 
If you don't care to calculate the table values by hand and insert the values in the code then 
you may of course make the program do the calculations. The time it takes to calculate the 
table is not significant as long as it is done only once. One may argue that it is safer to 
calculate the table in the program than to type in the values because a typo in a hand-
written table may go undetected. 
 
The principle of table lookup can be used in any situation where a program chooses 
between two or more constants. For example, a branch that chooses between two 
constants can be replaced by a table with two entries. This may improve the performance if 
the branch is poorly predictable. For example: 
 
// Example 14.2a 
float a;  int b; 
a = (b == 0) ? 1.0f : 2.5f; 
 
If we assume that b is always 0 or 1 and that the value is poorly predictable, then it is 
advantageous to replace the branch by a table lookup: 
 


---

 
// Example 14.2b 
float a;  int b; 
const float OneOrTwo5[2] = {1.0f, 2.5f}; 
a = OneOrTwo5[b & 1]; 
 
Here, I have AND'ed b with 1 for the sake of security. b & 1 is certain to have no other 
value than 0 or 1 (see page 138). This extra check on b can be omitted, of course, if the 
value of b is guaranteed to be 0 or 1. Writing a = OneOrTwo5[b!=0]; will also work, 
although slightly less efficiently. This method is inefficient, however, when b is a float or 
double because all the compilers I have tested implement OneOrTwo5[b!=0] as 
OneOrTwo5[(b!=0) ? 1 : 0] in this case so we don't get rid of the branch. It may seem 
illogical that the compiler uses a different implementation when b is floating point. The 
reason is, I guess, that compiler makers assume that floating point comparisons are more 
predictable than integer comparisons. The solution a = 1.0f + b * 1.5f; is efficient 
when b is a float, but not if b is an integer because the integer-to-float conversion takes 
more time than the table lookup. 
 
Lookup tables are particular advantageous as replacements for switch statements 
because switch statements often suffer from poor branch prediction. Example: 
 
// Example 14.3a 
int n; 
switch (n) { 
case 0: 
   printf("Alpha");  break; 
case 1: 
   printf("Beta");   break; 
case 2: 
   printf("Gamma");  break; 
case 3: 
   printf("Delta");  break; 
} 
 
This can be improved by using a lookup table: 
 
// Example 14.3b 
int n; 
char const * const Greek[4] = { 
   "Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma", "Delta" 
}; 
if ((unsigned int)n < 4) { // Check that index is not out of range 
   printf(Greek[n]); 
} 
 
The declaration of the table has const twice because both the pointers and the texts they 
point to are constant. 
 
14.2 Bounds checking 
In C++, it is often necessary to check if an array index is out of range. This may typically 
look like this: 
 
// Example 14.4a 
const int size = 16; int i; 
float list[size]; 
... 
if (i < 0 || i >= size) { 
   cout << "Error: Index out of range"; 
} 
else { 


---

 
   list[i] += 1.0f; 
} 
 
The two comparisons i < 0 and i >= size can be replaced by a single comparison: 
 
// Example 14.4b 
if ((unsigned int)i >= (unsigned int)size) { 
   cout << "Error: Index out of range"; 
} 
else { 
   list[i] += 1.0f; 
} 
 
A possible negative value of i will appear as a large positive number when i is 
interpreted as an unsigned integer and this will trigger the error condition. Replacing two 
comparisons by one makes the code faster because testing a condition is relatively 
expensive, while the type conversion generates no extra code at all. 
 
This method can be extended to the general case where you want to check whether an 
integer is within a certain interval: 
 
// Example 14.5a 
const int min = 100, max = 110;  int i; 
... 
if (i >= min && i <= max) { ... 
 
can be changed to: 
 
// Example 14.5b 
if ((unsigned int)(i - min) <= (unsigned int)(max - min)) { ... 
 
There is an even faster way to limit the range of an integer if the length of the desired 
interval is a power of 2. Example: 
 
// Example 14.6 
float list[16]; int i; 
... 
list[i & 15] += 1.0f; 
 
This needs a little explanation. The value of i&15 is guaranteed to be in the interval from 0 
to 15. If i is outside this interval, for example i = 18, then the & operator (bitwise and) will 
cut off the binary value of i to four bits, and the result will be 2. The result is the same as i 
modulo 16. This method is useful for preventing program errors in case the array index is 
out of range and we don't need an error message if it is. It is important to note that this 
method works only for powers of 2 (i.e. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ...). We can make sure that a 
value is less than 2n and not negative by AND'ing it with 2n -1. The bitwise AND operation 
isolates the least significant n bits of the number and sets all other bits to zero. 
 
14.3 Use bitwise operators for checking multiple values at once 
The bitwise operators &, |, ^, ~, <<, >> can test or manipulate all the bits of an integer in 
one operation. For example, if each bit of a 32-bit integer has a particular meaning, then you 
can set multiple bits in a single operation using the | operator; you can clear or mask out 
multiple bits with the & operator; and you can toggle multiple bits with the ^ operator. 
 
The & operator is also useful for testing multiple conditions in a single operation. Example: 
 
// Example 14.7a. Testing multiple conditions 
enum Weekdays { 


---

 
   Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday 
}; 
Weekdays Day; 
if (Day == Tuesday || Day == Wednesday || Day == Friday) { 
   DoThisThreeTimesAWeek(); 
} 
 
The if statement in this example has three conditions which are implemented as three 
branches. They can be joined into a single branch if the constants Sunday, Monday, etc. 
are defined as powers of 2: 
 
// Example 14.7b. Testing multiple conditions using & 
enum Weekdays { 
   Sunday = 1, Monday = 2, Tuesday = 4, Wednesday = 8,  
   Thursday = 0x10, Friday = 0x20, Saturday = 0x40 
}; 
Weekdays Day; 
if (Day & (Tuesday | Wednesday | Friday)) { 
   DoThisThreeTimesAWeek(); 
} 
 
By giving each constant a value that is a power of 2 in example 14.7b, we are in fact using 
each bit in Day for signifying one of the weekdays. The maximum number of constants we 
can define in this way is equal to the number of bits in an integer, usually 32. In 64-bit 
systems we can use 64-bit integers with hardly any loss of efficiency. 
 
The expression (Tuesday | Wednesday | Friday) in example 14.7b is converted by 
the compiler to the value 0x2C so that the if condition can be calculated by a single & 
operation, which is very fast. The result of the & operation will be non-zero, and therefore 
count as true, if any of the bits for Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday is set in the variable 
Day. 
 
Note the difference between the Boolean operators &&, ||, ! and the corresponding bitwise 
operators &, |, ~. The Boolean operators produce a single result, true (1) or false (0); and 
the second operand is evaluated only when needed. The bitwise operators produce 32 
results when applied to 32-bit integers, and they always evaluate both operands. 
Nevertheless, the bitwise operators are calculated much faster than the Boolean operators 
because they do not use branches, provided that the operands are integer expressions 
rather than Boolean expressions. 
 
There are lots of things you can do with bitwise operators using integers as Boolean 
vectors, and these operations are very fast. This can be useful in programs with many 
Boolean expressions. Whether the constants are defined with enum, const, or #define 
makes no difference for the performance. 
 
14.4 Integer multiplication 
Integer multiplication takes longer time than addition and subtraction (3 - 10 clock cycles, 
depending on the processor). Optimizing compilers will often replace integer multiplication 
by a constant with a combination of additions and shift operations. Multiplying by a power of 
2 is faster than multiplying by other constants because it can be done as a shift operation. 
For example, a * 16 is calculated as a << 4, and a * 17 is calculated as (a << 4) + 
a. 
 
You can take advantage of this by preferably using powers of 2 when multiplying with a 
constant. The compilers also have fast ways of multiplying by 3, 5 and 9. 
 


---

 
Multiplications are done implicitly when calculating the address of an array element. In some 
cases this multiplication will be faster when the factor is a power of 2. Example: 
 
// Example 14.8 
const int rows = 10, columns = 8; 
float matrix[rows][columns]; 
int i, j; 
int order(int x); 
... 
for (i = 0; i < rows; i++) { 
   j = order(i); 
   matrix[j][0] = i; 
} 
 
Here, the address of matrix[j][0] is calculated internally as  
(int)&matrix[0][0] + j * (columns * sizeof(float)). 
Now, the factor to multiply j by is (columns * sizeof(float)) = 8 * 4 = 32. This 
is a power of 2, so the compiler can replace j * 32 with j << 5. If columns had not 
been a power of 2 then the multiplication would take longer time. It can therefore be 
advantageous to make the number of columns in a matrix a power of 2 if the rows are 
accessed in a non-sequential order. 
 
The same applies to an array of structure or class elements. The size of each object should 
preferably be a power of 2 if the objects are accessed in a non-sequential order. Example: 
 
// Example 14.9 
struct S1 { 
   int a; 
   int b; 
   int c; 
   int UnusedFiller; 
}; 
int order(int x); 
const int size = 100; 
S1 list[size];  int i, j; 
... 
for (i = 0; i < size; i++) { 
   j = order(i); 
   list[j].a = list[j].b + list[j].c; 
} 
 
Here, we have inserted UnusedFiller in the structure to make sure its size is a power of 
2 in order to make the address calculation faster. 
 
The advantage of using powers of 2 applies only when elements are accessed in non-
sequential order. If the code in example 14.8 and 14.9 is changed so that it has i instead of 
j as index then the compiler can see that the addresses are accessed in sequential order 
and it can calculate each address by adding a constant to the preceding one (see page 72). 
In this case it doesn't matter if the size is a power of 2 or not. 
 
The advise of using powers of 2 does not apply to very big data structures. On the contrary, 
you should by all means avoid powers of 2 if a matrix is so big that caching becomes a 
problem. If the number of columns in a matrix is a power of 2 and the matrix is bigger than 
the cache then you can get very expensive cache contentions, as explained on page 98. 
 
14.5 Integer division 
Integer division takes much longer time than addition, subtraction and multiplication (27 - 80 
clock cycles for 32-bit integers, depending on the processor). 
 


---

 
Integer division by a power of 2 can be done with a shift operation, which is much faster. 
 
Division by a constant is faster than division by a variable because optimizing compilers can 
compute a / b as a * (2n / b) >> n with a suitable choice of n. The constant (2n / b) is 
calculated in advance and the multiplication is done with an extended number of bits. The 
method is somewhat more complicated because various corrections for sign and rounding 
errors must be added. This method is described in more detail in manual 2: "Optimizing 
subroutines in assembly language". The method is faster if the dividend is unsigned. 
 
The following guidelines can be used for improving code that contains integer division: 
 
 
Integer division by a constant is faster than division by a variable. Make sure the 
value of the divisor is known at compile time. 
 
 
Integer division by a constant is faster if the constant is a power of 2 
 
 
Integer division by a constant is faster if the dividend is unsigned 
 
Examples: 
 
// Example 14.10 
int a, b, c; 
a = b / c;                // This is slow 
a = b / 10;               // Division by a constant is faster 
a = (unsigned int)b / 10; // Still faster if unsigned 
a = b / 16;               // Faster if divisor is a power of 2 
a = (unsigned int)b / 16; // Still faster if unsigned 
 
The same rules apply to modulo calculations: 
 
// Example 14.11 
int a, b, c; 
a = b % c;                // This is slow 
a = b % 10;               // Modulo by a constant is faster 
a = (unsigned int)b % 10; // Still faster if unsigned 
a = b % 16;               // Faster if divisor is a power of 2 
a = (unsigned int)b % 16; // Still faster if unsigned 
 
You can take advantage of these guidelines by using a constant divisor that is a power of 2 
if possible and by changing the dividend to unsigned if you are sure that it will not be 
negative. 
 
The method described above can still be used if the value of the divisor is not known at 
compile time, but the program is dividing repeatedly with the same divisor. In this case you 
have to do the necessary calculations of (2n / b) etc. at compile time. The function library at 
www.agner.org/optimize/asmlib.zip contains various functions for these calculations. 
 
Division of a loop counter by a constant can be avoided by rolling out the loop by the same 
constant. Example: 
 
// Example 14.12a 
int list[300]; 
int i; 
for (i = 0;  i < 300;  i++) { 
   list[i] += i / 3; 
} 
 
This can be replaced with: 
 
// Example 14.12b 


---

 
int list[300]; 
int i, i_div_3; 
for (i = i_div_3 = 0;  i < 300;  i += 3, i_div_3++) { 
   list[i]   += i_div_3; 
   list[i+1] += i_div_3; 
   list[i+2] += i_div_3; 
} 
 
A similar method can be used to avoid modulo operations: 
 
// Example 14.13a 
int list[300]; 
int i; 
for (i = 0;  i < 300;  i++) { 
   list[i] = i % 3; 
} 
 
This can be replaced with: 
 
// Example 14.13b 
int list[300]; 
int i; 
for (i = 0;  i < 300;  i += 3) { 
   list[i]   = 0; 
   list[i+1] = 1; 
   list[i+2] = 2; 
} 
 
The loop unrolling in example 14.12b and 14.13b works only if the loop count is divisible by 
the unroll factor. If not, then you must do the extra operations outside the loop: 
 
// Example 14.13c 
int list[301]; 
int i; 
for (i = 0;  i < 301;  i += 3) { 
   list[i]   = 0; 
   list[i+1] = 1; 
   list[i+2] = 2; 
} 
list[300] = 0; 
 
14.6 Floating point division 
Floating point division takes much longer time than addition, subtraction and multiplication 
(20 - 45 clock cycles). 
 
Floating point division by a constant should be done by multiplying with the reciprocal: 
 
// Example 14.14a 
double a, b; 
a = b / 1.2345; 
 
Change this to: 
 
// Example 14.14b 
double a, b; 
a = b * (1. / 1.2345); 
 
The compiler will calculate (1./1.2345) at compile time and insert the reciprocal in the 
code, so you will never spend time doing the division. Some compilers will replace the code 


---

 
in example 14.14a with 14.14b automatically but only if certain options are set to relax 
floating point precision (see page 74). It is therefore safer to do this optimization explicitly. 
 
Divisions can sometimes be eliminated completely. For example: 
 
// Example 14.15a 
if (a > b / c) 
 
can sometimes be replaced by 
 
// Example 14.15b 
if (a * c > b) 
 
But beware of the pitfalls here: The inequality sign must be reversed if c < 0. The division is 
inexact if b and c are integers, while the multiplication is exact. 
 
Multiple divisions can be combined. For example: 
 
// Example 14.16a 
double y, a1, a2, b1, b2; 
y = a1/b1 + a2/b2;   
 
Here we can eliminate one division by making a common denominator: 
 
// Example 14.16b 
double y, a1, a2, b1, b2; 
y = (a1*b2 + a2*b1) / (b1*b2);   
 
The trick of using a common denominator can even be used on completely independent 
divisions. Example: 
 
// Example 14.17a 
double a1, a2, b1, b2, y1, y2; 
y1 = a1 / b1; 
y2 = a2 / b2; 
 
This can be changed to: 
 
// Example 14.17b 
double a1, a2, b1, b2, y1, y2, reciprocal_divisor; 
reciprocal_divisor = 1. / (b1 * b2); 
y1 = a1 * b2 * reciprocal_divisor; 
y2 = a2 * b1 * reciprocal_divisor; 
 
14.7 Don't mix float and double 
Floating point calculations usually take the same time regardless of whether you are using 
single precision or double precision, but there is a penalty for mixing single and double 
precision in programs compiled for 64-bit operating systems and programs compiled for the 
instruction set SSE2 or later. Example:  
 
// Example 14.18a 
float a, b; 
a = b * 1.2;       // Mixing float and double is bad 
 
The C/C++ standard specifies that all floating point constants are double precision by 
default, so 1.2 in this example is a double precision constant. It is therefore necessary to 
convert b from single precision to double precision before multiplying with the double 
precision constant and then convert the result back to single precision. These conversions 


---

 
take a lot of time. You can avoid the conversions and make the code up to 5 times faster 
either by making the constant single precision or by making a and b double precision: 
 
// Example 14.18b 
float a, b; 
a = b * 1.2f;      // everything is float 
 
// Example 14.18c 
double a, b; 
a = b * 1.2;       // everything is double 
 
There is no penalty for mixing different floating point precisions when the code is compiled 
for old processors without the SSE2 instruction set, but it may be preferable to keep the 
same precision in all operands in case the code is later ported to another platform. 
 
14.8 Conversions between floating point numbers and integers 
Conversion from floating point to integer 
According to the standards for the C++ language, all conversions from floating point 
numbers to integers use truncation towards zero, rather than rounding. This is unfortunate 
because truncation takes much longer time than rounding unless the SSE2 instruction set is 
used. It is recommended to enable the SSE2 instruction set if possible. SSE2 is always 
enabled in 64-bit mode. 
 
A conversion from floating point to integer without SSE2 typically takes 40 clock cycles. If 
you cannot avoid conversions from float or double to int in the critical part of the 
code, then you may improve efficiency by using rounding instead of truncation. This is 
approximately three times faster. The logic of the program may need modification to 
compensate for the difference between rounding and truncation. 
 
Efficient conversion from float or double to integer can be done with the functions 
lrintf and lrint. Unfortunately, these functions are missing in many commercial 
compilers due to controversies over the C99 standard. An implementation of the lrint 
function is given in example 14.19 below. The function rounds a floating point number to the 
nearest integer. If two integers are equally near then the even integer is returned. There is 
no check for overflow. This function is intended for 32-bit Windows and 32-bit Linux with 
Microsoft, Intel and Gnu compilers. 
 
// Example 14.19 
static inline int lrint (double const x) { // Round to nearest integer  
   int n; 
#if defined(__unix__) || defined(__GNUC__) 
   // 32-bit Linux, Gnu/AT&T syntax: 
   __asm ("fldl %1 \n fistpl %0 " : "=m"(n) : "m"(x) : "memory" ); 
#else 
   // 32-bit Windows, Intel/MASM syntax: 
   __asm fld qword ptr x; 
   __asm fistp dword ptr n; 
#endif 
   return n;} 
 
This code will work only on Intel/x86-compatible microprocessors. The function is also 
available in the function library at www.agner.org/optimize/asmlib.zip.  
 
The following example shows how to use the lrint function: 
 
// Example 14.20 
double d = 1.6; 


---

 
int a, b; 
a = (int)d;      // Truncation is slow. Value of a will be 1 
b = lrint(d);    // Rounding is fast. Value of b will be 2 
 
In 64-bit mode or when the SSE2 instruction set is enabled there is no difference in speed 
between rounding and truncation. The missing functions can be implemented as follows in 
64-bit mode or when the SSE2 instruction set is enabled: 
 
// Example 14.21.  // Only for SSE2 or x64 
#include <emmintrin.h> 
 
static inline int lrintf (float const x) { 
   return _mm_cvtss_si32(_mm_load_ss(&x));} 
 
static inline int lrint (double const x) { 
   return _mm_cvtsd_si32(_mm_load_sd(&x));} 
 
The code in example 14.21 is faster than other methods of rounding, but neither faster nor 
slower than truncation when the SSE2 instruction set is enabled. 
Conversion from integer to floating point 
Conversion of integers to floating point is faster than from floating point to integer. The 
conversion time is typically between 5 and 20 clock cycles. It may in some cases be 
advantageous to do simple integer calculations in floating point variables in order to avoid 
conversions from integer to floating point. 
 
Conversion of unsigned integers to floating point numbers is less efficient than signed 
integers. It is more efficient to convert unsigned integers to signed integers before 
conversion to floating point if the conversion to signed integer doesn't cause overflow. 
Example: 
 
// Example 14.22a 
unsigned int u;  double d; 
d = u; 
 
If you are certain that u < 231 then convert it to signed before converting to floating point: 
 
// Example 14.22b 
unsigned int u;  double d; 
d = (double)(signed int)u; 
 
14.9 Using integer operations for manipulating floating point variables 
Floating point numbers are stored in a binary representation according to the IEEE standard 
754 (1985). This standard is used in almost all modern microprocessors and operating 
systems (but not in some very old DOS compilers). 
 
The representation of float, double and long double reflects the floating point value 
written as 2eee1.fffff, where  is the sign, eee is the exponent, and fffff is the 
binary decimals of the fraction. The sign is stored as a single bit which is 0 for positive and 1 
for negative numbers. The exponent is stored as a biased binary integer, and the fraction is 
stored as the binary digits. The exponent is always normalized, if possible, so that the value 
before the decimal point is 1. This '1' is not included in the representation, except in the 
long double format. The formats can be expressed as follows: 
 
struct Sfloat { 
   unsigned int fraction : 23; // fractional part 
   unsigned int exponent :  8; // exponent + 0x7F 
   unsigned int sign     :  1; // sign bit 


---

 
}; 
 
struct Sdouble { 
   unsigned int fraction : 52; // fractional part 
   unsigned int exponent : 11; // exponent + 0x3FF 
   unsigned int sign     :  1; // sign bit 
}; 
 
struct Slongdouble { 
   unsigned int fraction : 63; // fractional part 
   unsigned int one      :  1; // always 1 if nonzero and normal 
   unsigned int exponent : 15; // exponent + 0x3FFF 
   unsigned int sign     :  1; // sign bit 
}; 
 
The values of nonzero floating point numbers can be calculated as follows:

The value is zero if all bits except the sign bit are zero. Zero can be represented with or 
without the sign bit. 
 
The fact that the floating point format is standardized allows us to manipulate the different 
parts of the floating point representation directly with the use of integer operations. This can 
be an advantage because integer operations are faster than floating point operations. You 
should use such methods only if you are sure you know what you are doing. See the end of 
this section for some caveats. 
 
We can change the sign of a floating point number simply by inverting the sign bit: 
 
// Example 14.23 
union { 
   float f; 
   int i; 
} u; 
u.i ^= 0x80000000; // flip sign bit of u.f 
 
We can take the absolute value by setting the sign bit to zero: 
 
// Example 14.24 
union { 
   float f; 
   int i; 
} u; 
u.i &= 0x7FFFFFFF; // set sign bit to zero 
 
We can check if a floating point number is zero by testing all bits except the sign bit: 
 
// Example 14.25 
union { 
   float f; 
   int i; 
} u; 
if (u.i & 0x7FFFFFFF) { // test bits 0 - 30 
   // f is nonzero 
} 
else { 
   // f is zero 


---

 
} 
 
We can multiply a nonzero floating point number by 2n by adding n to the exponent: 
 
// Example 14.26 
union { 
   float f; 
   int i; 
} u; 
int n; 
if (u.i & 0x7FFFFFFF) { // check if nonzero    
   u.i += n << 23;      // add n to exponent 
} 
 
Example 14.26 does not check for overflow and works only for positive n. You can divide by 
2n by subtracting n from the exponent if there is no risk of underflow. 
 
The fact that the representation of the exponent is biased allows us to compare two positive 
floating point numbers simply by comparing them as integers: 
 
// Example 14.27 
union { 
   float f; 
   int i; 
} u, v; 
if (u.i > v.i) { 
   // u.f > v.f if both positive 
} 
 
Example 14.27 assumes that we know that u.f and v.f are both positive. It will fail if both 
are negative or if one is 0 and the other is -0 (zero with sign bit set).  
 
We can shift out the sign bit to compare absolute values: 
 
// Example 14.28 
union { 
   float f; 
   unsigned int i; 
} u, v; 
if (u.i * 2 > v.i * 2) { 
   // abs(u.f) > abs(v.f) 
} 
 
The multiplication by 2 in example 14.28 will shift out the sign bit so that the remaining bits 
represent a monotonically increasing function of the absolute value of the floating point 
number. 
 
We can convert an integer in the interval 0 <= n < 223 to a floating point number in the 
interval [1.0, 2.0) by setting the fraction bits: 
 
// Example 14.29 
union { 
   float f; 
   int i; 
} u; 
int n; 
u.i = (n & 0x7FFFFF) | 0x3F800000; // Now 1.0 <= u.f < 2.0 
 
This method is useful for random number generators. 
 


---

 
In general, it is faster to access a floating point variable as an integer if it is stored in 
memory, but not if it is a register variable. The union forces the variable to be stored in 
memory, at least temporarily. Using the methods in the above examples will therefore be a 
disadvantage if other nearby parts of the code could benefit from using registers for the 
same variables.  
 
In these examples we are using unions rather than type casting of pointers because this 
method is safer. Type casting of pointers may not work on compilers that rely on the strict 
aliasing rule of standard C, specifying that pointers of different types cannot point to the 
same object, except for char pointers. 
 
The above examples all use single precision. Using double precision in 32-bit systems gives 
rise to some extra complications. A double is represented with 64 bits, but 32-bit systems do 
not have inherent support for 64-bit integers. Many 32-bit systems allow you to define 64-bit 
integers, but they are in fact represented as two 32-bit integers, which is less efficient. You 
may use the upper 32 bits of a double which gives access to the sign bit, the exponent, 
and the most significant part of the fraction. For example, to test the sign of a double: 
 
// Example 14.23b 
union { 
   double d; 
   int i[2]; 
} u; 
if (u.i[1] < 0) {  // test sign bit 
   // u.d is negative or -0 
} 
 
It is not recommended to modify a double by modifying only half of it, for example if you 
want to flip the sign bit in the above example with u.i[1] ^= 0x80000000; because this 
is likely to generate a store forwarding delay in the CPU (See manual 3: "The 
microarchitecture of Intel, AMD and VIA CPUs"). This can be avoided in 64-bit systems by 
using a 64-bit integer rather than two 32-bit integers to alias upon the double. 
 
Another problem with accessing 32 bits of a 64-bit double is that it is not portable to systems 
with big-endian storage. Example 14.23b and 14.30 will therefore need modification if 
implemented on other platforms with big-endian storage. All x86 platforms (Windows, Linux, 
BSD, Intel-based Mac OS, etc.) have little-endian storage, but other systems may have big 
endian storage (e.g. PowerPC). 
 
We can make an approximate comparison of doubles by comparing bits 32-62. This can be 
useful for finding the numerically largest element in a matrix for use as pivot in a Gauss 
elimination. The method in example 14.28 can be implemented like this in a pivot search: 
 
// Example 14.30 
const int size = 100; 
// Array of 100 doubles: 
union {double d; unsigned int u[2]} a[size]; 
unsigned int absvalue, largest_abs = 0; 
int i, largest_index = 0; 
for (i = 0; i < size; i++) { 
   // Get upper 32 bits of a[i] and shift out sign bit: 
   absvalue = a[i].u[1] * 2; 
   // Find numerically largest element (approximately): 
   if (absvalue > largest_abs) { 
      largest_abs = absvalue; 
      largest_index = i; 
   } 
} 
 


---

 
Example 14.30 finds the numerically largest element in an array, or approximately so. It may 
fail to distinguish elements with a relative difference less than 2-20, but this is sufficiently 
accurate for the purpose of finding a suitable pivot element. The integer comparison is likely 
to be faster than a floating point comparison. On big endian systems you have to replace 
u[1] by u[0]. 
 
14.10 Mathematical functions 
The most common mathematical functions such as logarithms, exponential functions, 
trigonometric functions, etc. are implemented in hardware in the x86 CPUs. However, a 
software implementation is faster than the hardware implementation in most cases when the 
SSE2 instruction set is available. The best compilers use the software implementation if the 
SSE2 instruction set is enabled. 
 
The advantage of using a software implementation rather than a hardware implementation 
of these functions is higher for single precision than for double precision. But the software 
implementation is faster than the hardware implementation in most cases, even for double 
precision. 
 
You may use the Intel math function library with a different compiler by including the library 
libmmt.lib and the header file mathimf.h that come with the Intel C++ compiler. This 
library contains many useful mathematical functions. A lot of advanced mathematical 
functions are supplied in Intel's Math Kernel Library, available from www.intel.com. (See 
also page 122). The AMD math core library contains similar functions, but less optimized. 
 
Note that the Intel function libraries do not use the best possible instruction set when 
running on non-Intel processors (see page 133 for how to overcome this limitation). 
 
14.11 Static versus dynamic libraries 
Function libraries can be implemented either as static link libraries (*.lib, *.a) or dynamic 
link libraries, also called shared objects (*.dll, *.so). The mechanism of static linking is 
that the linker extracts the functions that are needed from the library file and copies them 
into the executable file. Only the executable file needs to be distributed to the end user. 
 
Dynamic linking works differently. The link to a function in a dynamic library is resolved 
when the library is loaded or at run time. Therefore, both the executable file and one or 
more dynamic libraries are loaded into memory when the program is run. Both the 
executable file and all the dynamic libraries need to be distributed to the end user. 
 
The advantages of using static linking rather than dynamic linking are: 
 
 
Static linking includes only the part of the library that is actually needed by the 
application, while dynamic linking makes the entire library (or at least a large part of it) 
load into memory even when just a single function from the library is needed. 
 
 
All the code is included in a single executable file when static linking is used. Dynamic 
linking makes it necessary to load several files when the program is started. 
 
 
It takes longer time to call a function in a dynamic library than in a static link library 
because it needs an extra jump through a pointer in an import table and possibly also a 
lookup in a procedure linkage table (PLT). 
 
 
The memory space becomes more fragmented when the code is distributed between 
multiple dynamic libraries. The dynamic libraries are loaded at round memory addresses 
divisible by the memory page size (4096). This will make all dynamic libraries contend 


---

 
for the same cache lines. This makes code caching and data caching less efficient. 
 
 
Dynamic libraries are less efficient in some systems because of the needs of position-
independent code, see below. 
 
 
Installing a second application that uses a newer version of the same dynamic library 
can change the behavior of the first application if dynamic linking is used, but not if static 
linking is used. 
 
The advantages of dynamic linking are: 
 
 
Multiple applications running simultaneously can share the same dynamic libraries 
without the need to load more than one instance of the library into memory. This is 
useful on servers that run many processes simultaneously. Actually, only the code 
section and read-only data sections can be shared. Any writable data section needs one 
instance for each process. 
 
 
A dynamic library can be updated to a new version without the need to update the 
program that calls it. 
 
 
A dynamic library can be called from programming languages that do not support static 
linking. 
 
 
A dynamic library can be useful for making plug-ins that add functionality to an existing 
program. 
 
Weighing the above advantages of each method, it is clear that static linking is preferable 
for speed-critical functions. Many function libraries are available in both static and dynamic 
versions. It is recommended to use the static version if speed is important. 
 
Some systems allow lazy binding of function calls. The principle of lazy binding is that the 
address of a linked function is not resolved when the program is loaded, but waits until the 
first time the function is called. Lazy binding can be useful for large libraries where only few 
of the functions are actually called in a single session. But lazy binding definitely degrades 
performance for the functions that are called. A considerable delay comes when a function 
is called for the first time because it needs to load the dynamic linker. 
 
The delay on lazy binding leads to a usability problem in interactive programs because the 
response time to e.g. a menu click becomes inconsistent and sometimes unacceptably long. 
Lazy binding should therefore be used only for very large libraries. 
 
The memory address at which a dynamic library is loaded cannot be determined in 
advance, because a fixed address might clash with another dynamic library requiring the 
same address. There are two commonly used methods for dealing with this problem: 
 
1. Relocation. All pointers and addresses in the code are modified, if necessary, to fit 
the actual load address. Relocation is done by the linker and the loader. 
   
2. Position-independent code. All addresses in the code are relative to the current 
position. 
 
Windows DLLs use relocation. The DLLs are relocated by the linker to a specific load 
address. If this address is not vacant then the DLL is relocated (rebased) once more by the 
loader to a different address. A call from the main executable to a function in a DLL goes 
through an import table or a pointer. A variable in a DLL can be accessed from main 
through an imported pointer, but this feature is seldom used. It is more common to 
exchange data or pointers to data through function calls. Internal references to data within 


---

 
the DLL use absolute references in 32 bit mode and mostly relative references in 64 bit 
mode. The latter is slightly more efficient because relative references do not need relocation 
at load time. 
 
Shared objects in Unix-like systems use position-independent code by default. This is less 
efficient than relocation, especially in 32-bit mode. The next chapter describes how this 
works and suggests methods for avoiding the costs of position-independent code. 
 
14.12 Position-independent code 
Shared objects in Linux, BSD and Mac systems normally use the so-called position-
independent code. The name "position-independent code" actually implies more than it 
says. A code that is compiled as position-independent has the following features: 
 
 
The code section contains no absolute addresses that need relocation, but only self-
relative addresses. Therefore, the code section can be loaded at an arbitrary 
memory address and shared between multiple processes. 
   
 
The data section is not shared between multiple processes because it often contains 
writeable data. Therefore, the data section may contain pointers or addresses that 
need relocation. 
   
 
All public functions and public data can be overridden in Linux and BSD. If a function 
in the main executable has the same name as a function in a shared object, then the 
version in main will take precedence, not only when called from main, but also when 
called from the shared object. Likewise, when a global variable in main has the same 
name as a global variable in the shared object, then the instance in main will be 
used, even when accessed from the shared object. This so-called symbol 
interposition is intended to mimic the behavior of static libraries. A shared object has 
a table of pointers to its functions, called procedure linkage table (PLT) and a table 
of pointers to its variables called global offset table (GOT) in order to implement this 
"override" feature. All accesses to functions and public variables go through the PLT 
and GOT. 
 
The symbol interposition feature that allows overriding of public functions and data in Linux 
and BSD comes at a high price, and in most libraries it is never used. Whenever a function 
in a shared object is called, it is necessary to look up the function address in the procedure 
linkage table (PLT). And whenever a public variable in a shared object is accessed, it is 
necessary to first look up the address of the variable in the global offset table (GOT). These 
table lookups are needed even when the function or variable is accessed from within the 
same shared object. Obviously, all these table lookup operations slow down the execution 
considerably. A more detailed discussion can be found at 
http://www.macieira.org/blog/2012/01/sorry-state-of-dynamic-libraries-on-linux/ 
 
Another serious burden is the calculation of self-relative references in 32-bit mode. The 32-
bit x86 instruction set has no instruction for self-relative addressing of data. The code goes 
through the following steps to access a public data object: (1) get its own address through a 
function call. (2) find the GOT through a self-relative address. (3) look up the address of the 
data object in the GOT, and finally (4) access the data object through this address. Step (1) 
is not needed in 64-bit mode because the x86-64 instruction set supports self-relative 
addressing. 
 
In 32-bit Linux and BSD, the slow GOT lookup process is used for all static data, including 
local data that don't need the "override" feature. This includes static variables, floating point 
constants, string constants, and initialized arrays. I have no explanation why this delaying 
process is used when it is not needed. 
 


---

 
Obviously, the best way to avoid the burdensome position-independent code and table 
lookup is to use static linking, as explained in the previous chapter (page 149). In the cases 
where dynamic linking cannot be avoided, there are various ways to avoid the time-
consuming features of the position-independent code. These workaround methods depend 
on the system, as explained below. 
Shared objects in 32 bit Linux 
Shared objects are normally compiled with the option -fpic according to the Gnu 
compiler manual. This option makes the code section position-independent, makes a PLT 
for all functions and a GOT for all public and static data. 
 
It is possible to compile a shared object without the -fpic option. Then we get rid of all 
the problems mentioned above. Now the code will run faster because we can access 
internal variables and internal functions in a single step rather than the complicated address 
calculation and table lookup mechanisms explained above. A shared object compiled 
without -fpic is much faster, except perhaps for a very large shared object where most of 
the functions are never called. The disadvantage of compiling without -fpic in 32-bit Linux 
is that the loader will have more references to relocate, but these address calculations are 
done only once, while the runtime address calculations have to be done at every access. 
The code section needs one instance for each process when compiled without -fpic 
because the relocations in the code section will be different for each process. Obviously, we 
lose the ability to override public symbols, but this feature is rarely needed anyway. 
 
You may preferably avoid global variables or hide them for the sake of portability to 64-bit 
mode, as explained below. 
Shared objects in 64 bit Linux 
The procedure to calculate self-relative addresses is much simpler in 64-bit mode because 
the 64-bit instruction set has support for relative addressing of data. The need for special 
position-independent code is smaller because relative addresses are often used by default 
anyway in 64-bit code. However, we still want to get rid of the GOT and PLT lookups for 
local references. 
 
If we compile the shared object without -fpic in 64 bit mode, we encounter another 
problem. The compiler sometimes uses 32-bit absolute addresses, mainly for static arrays. 
This works in the main executable because it is sure to be loaded at an address below 2 
GB, but not in a shared object which is typically loaded at a higher address which can't be 
reached with a 32-bit (signed) address. The linker will generate an error message in this 
case. The best solution is to compile with the option -fpie instead of -fpic. This will 
generate relative addresses in the code section, but it will not use GOT and PLT for internal 
references. Therefore, it will run faster than when compiled with -fpic and it will not have 
the disadvantages mentioned above for the 32-bit case. The -fpie option is less useful in 
32-bit mode, where it still uses a GOT.  
 
Another possibility is to compile with -mcmodel=large, but this will use full 64-bit 
addresses for everything, which is quite inefficient, and it will generate relocations in the 
code section so that it cannot be shared. 
 
You can't have public variables in a 64-bit shared object made with option -fpie because 
the linker makes an error message when it sees a relative reference to a public variable 
where it expects a GOT entry. You can avoid this error by avoiding any public variables. All 
global variables (i.e. variables defined outside any function) should be hidden by using the 
declaration "static" or "__attribute__((visibility ("hidden")))".  
 
The gnu compiler version 5.1 and later has an option -fno-semantic-interposition, 
which makes it avoid the use of PLT and GOT look, but only for references within the same 


---

 
file. The same effect can be obtained by using inline assembly code to give the variable two 
names, one global and one local, and use the local name for local references. 
 
Despite these tricks, you may still get the error message: "relocation R_X86_64_PC32 
against symbol `functionname' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile 
with -fPIC", when the shared object is made from multiple modules (source files) and there 
is a call from one module to another. I have not yet found a solution to this problem. 
 
Shared objects in BSD 
Shared objects in BSD work the same way as in Linux. 
32-bit Mac OS X 
Compilers for 32-bit Mac OS X make position-independent code and lazy binding by default, 
even when shared objects are not used. The method currently used for calculating self-
relative addresses in 32-bit Mac code uses an unfortunate method that delays execution by 
causing return addresses to be mispredicted (See manual 3: "The microarchitecture of Intel, 
AMD and VIA CPUs" for an explanation of return prediction). 
 
All code that is not part of a shared object can be speeded up significantly just by turning off 
the position-independent code flag in the compiler. Remember, therefore, always to specify 
the compiler option -fno-pic when compiling for 32-bit Mac OS X, unless you are making 
a shared object. 
 
It is possible to make shared objects without position-independent code when you compile 
with the option -fno-pic and link with the option -read_only_relocs suppress. 
 
GOT and PLT tables are not used for internal references.  
64-bit Mac OS X 
The code section is always position-independent because this is the most efficient solution 
for the memory model used here. The compiler option -fno-pic apparently has no effect. 
 
GOT and PLT tables are not used for internal references.  
 
There is no need to take special precautions for speeding up 64-bit shared objects in Mac 
OS X. 
 
14.13 System programming 
Device drivers, interrupt service routines, system core and high-priority threads are areas 
where speed is particularly critical. A very time-consuming function in system code or in a 
high-priority thread can possibly block the execution of everything else. 
 
System code has to obey certain rules about register use, as explained in the chapter 
"Register usage in kernel code" in manual 5: "Calling conventions for different C++ 
compilers and operating systems". For this reason, you can use only compilers and function 
libraries that are intended for system code. System code should be written in C, C++ or 
assembly language. 
 
It is important to economize resource use in system code. Dynamic memory allocation is 
particularly risky because it involves the risk of activating the very time-consuming garbage 
collector at inconvenient times. A queue should be implemented as a circular buffer with 
fixed size, not as a linked list. Do not use STL containers. See page 91.
