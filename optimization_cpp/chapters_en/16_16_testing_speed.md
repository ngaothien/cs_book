# 16 Testing speed

 
names from string functions. A metaprogramming implementation analogous to example 
15.1b and d in assembly language is provided as an example in the "Macro loops" chapter 
in manual 2: "Optimizing subroutines in assembly language". 
 
While we are waiting for better metaprogramming tools to be available, we may choose the 
compilers that are best at doing equivalent reductions at their own initiative whenever it is 
possible. A compiler that automatically reduces example 15.1a to 15.1c would of course be 
the easiest and the most reliable solution. (In my tests, the Intel compiler reduced 15.1a to 
an inlined 15.1b and the Gnu compiler reduced 15.1b to 15.1c, but none of the compilers 
reduced 15.1a to 15.1c). 
 
 
16 Testing speed 
Testing the speed of a program is an important part of the optimization job. You have to 
check if your modifications actually increase the speed or not. 
 
There are various profilers available which are useful for finding the hot spots and 
measuring the overall performance of a program. The profilers are not always accurate, 
however, and it may be difficult to measure exactly what you want when the program 
spends most of its time waiting for user input or reading disk files. See page 16 for a 
discussion of profiling. 
 
When a hot spot has been identified, then it may be useful to isolate the hot spot and make 
measurements on this part of the code only. This can be done with the resolution of the 
CPU clock by using the so-called time stamp counter. This is a counter that measures the 
number of clock pulses since the CPU was started. The length of a clock cycle is the 
reciprocal of the clock frequency, as explained on page 16. If you read the value of the time 
stamp counter before and after executing a critical piece of code then you can get the exact 
time consumption as the difference between the two clock counts. 
 
The value of the time stamp counter can be obtained with the function ReadTSC listed 
below in example 16.1. This code works only for compilers that support intrinsic functions. 
Alternatively, you can use the header file timingtest.h from 
www.agner.org/optimize/testp.zip or get ReadTSC as a library function from 
www.agner.org/optimize/asmlib.zip. 
 
// Example 16.1 
#include <intrin.h>        // Or #include <ia32intrin.h> etc. 
 
long long ReadTSC() {      // Returns time stamp counter 
   int dummy[4];           // For unused returns 
   volatile int DontSkip;  // Volatile to prevent optimizing 
   long long clock;        // Time 
   __cpuid(dummy, 0);      // Serialize 
   DontSkip = dummy[0];    // Prevent optimizing away cpuid 
   clock = __rdtsc();      // Read time 
   return clock; 
} 
 
You can use this function to measure the clock count before and after executing the critical 
code. A test setup may look like this: 
 
// Example 16.2 
 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <asmlib.h>        // Use ReadTSC() from library asmlib.. 
                           // or from example 16.1 
void CriticalFunction();   // This is the function we want to measure 


---

 
 
... 
 
const int NumberOfTests = 10;         // Number of times to test 
int i; long long time1; 
long long timediff[NumberOfTests];    // Time difference for each test 
for (i = 0; i < NumberOfTests; i++) { // Repeat NumberOfTests times 
 
   time1 = ReadTSC();                 // Time before test 
 
   CriticalFunction();                // Critical function to test 
 
   timediff[i] = ReadTSC() - time1;   // (time after) - (time before) 
} 
printf("\nResults:");                 // Print heading 
for (i = 0; i < NumberOfTests; i++) { // Loop to print out results 
   printf("\n%2i  %10I64i", i, timediff[i]); 
} 
 
The code in example 16.2 calls the critical function ten times and stores the time 
consumption of each run in an array. The values are then output after the test loop. The 
time that is measured in this way includes the time it takes to call the ReadTSC function. 
You can subtract this value from the counts. It is measured simply by removing the call to 
CriticalFunction in example 16.2. 
 
The measured time is interpreted in the following way. The first count is usually higher than 
the subsequent counts. This is the time it takes to execute CriticalFunction when code 
and data are not cached. The subsequent counts give the execution time when code and 
data are cached as good as possible. The first count and the subsequent counts represent 
the "worst case" and "best case" values. Which of these two values is closest to the truth 
depends on whether CriticalFunction is called once or multiple times in the final 
program and whether there is other code that uses the cache in between the calls to 
CriticalFunction. If your optimization effort is concentrated on CPU efficiency then it is 
the "best case" counts that you should look at to see if a certain modification is profitable. 
On the other hand, if your optimization effort is concentrated on arranging data in order to 
improve cache efficiency, then you may also look at the "worst case" counts. In any event, 
the clock counts should be multiplied by the clock period and by the number of times 
CriticalFunction is called in a typical application to calculate the time delay that the 
end user is likely to experience. 
 
Occasionally, the clock counts that you measure are much higher than normal. This 
happens when a task switch occurs during execution of CriticalFunction. You cannot 
avoid this in a protected operating system, but you can reduce the problem by increasing 
the thread priority before the test and setting the priority back to normal afterwards. 
 
The clock counts are often fluctuating and it may be difficult to get reproducible results. This 
is because modern CPUs can change their clock frequency dynamically depending on the 
work load. The clock frequency is increased when the work load is high and decreased 
when the work load is low in order to save power. There are various ways to get more 
reproducible time measurements: 
 
 
warm up the CPU by giving it some heavy work to do immediately before the code to 
test. 
 
disable power-save options in the BIOS setup. 
 
on Intel CPUs: use the core clock cycle counter (see below)

16.1 Using performance monitor counters 
Many CPUs have a built-in test feature called performance monitor counters. A performance 
monitor counter is a counter inside the CPU which can be set up to count certain events, 
such as the number of machine instructions executed, cache misses, branch 
mispredictions, etc. These counters can be very useful for investigating performance 
problems. The performance monitor counters are CPU-specific and each CPU model has its 
own set of performance monitoring options. 
 
CPU vendors are offering profiling tools that fit their CPUs. Intel's profiler is called VTune; 
AMD's profiler is called CodeAnalyst. These profilers are useful for identifying hot spots in 
the code. 
 
For my own research, I have developed a test tool for using the performance monitor 
counters. My test tool supports both Intel, AMD and VIA processors, and it is available from 
www.agner.org/optimize/testp.zip. This tool is not a profiler. It is not intended for finding hot 
spots, but for studying a piece of code once the hot spots have been identified. 
 
My test tool can be used in two ways. The first way is to insert the piece of code to test in 
the test program itself and recompile it. I am using this for testing single assembly 
instructions or small sequences of code. The second way is to set up the performance 
monitor counters before running a program you want to optimize, and reading the 
performance counters inside your program before and after the piece of code you want to 
test. You can use the same principle as in example 16.2 above, but read one or more 
performance monitor counters instead of (or in addition to) the time stamp counter. The test 
tool can set up and enable one or more performance monitor counters in all the CPU cores 
and leave them enabled (there is one set of counters in each CPU core). The counters will 
stay on until you turn them off or until the computer is reset or goes into sleep mode. See 
the manual for my test tool for details (www.agner.org/optimize/testp.zip). 
 
A particularly useful performance monitor counter in Intel processors is called core clock 
cycles. The core clock cycles counter is counting clock cycles at the actual clock frequency 
that the CPU core is running at, rather than the external clock. This gives a measure that is 
almost independent of changes in the clock frequency. The core clock cycle counter is very 
useful when testing which version of a piece of code is fastest because you can avoid the 
problem that the clock frequency goes up and down. 
 
Remember to insert a switch in your program to turn off the reading of the counters when 
you are not testing. Trying to read the performance monitor counters when they are 
disabled will crash the program. 
 
16.2 The pitfalls of unit-testing 
It is common practice to test each function or class separately in software development. 
This unit-testing is necessary for verifying the functionality of an optimized function, but 
unfortunately the unit-test does not give the full information about the performance of the 
function in terms of speed. 
 
Assume that you have two different versions of a critical function and you want to find out 
which one is fastest. The typical way to test this is to make a small test program that calls 
the critical function many times with a suitable set of test data and measure how long time it 
takes. The version that performs best under this unit-test may have a larger memory 
footprint than the alternative version. The penalty of cache misses is not seen in the unit-
test because the total amount of code and data memory used by the test program is likely to 
be less than the cache size. 
 
When the critical function is inserted in the final program, it is very likely that code cache 
and data cache are critical resources. Modern CPUs are so fast that the clock cycles spent 


---

 
on executing instructions are less likely to be a bottleneck than memory access and cache 
size. If this is the case then the optimal version of the critical function may be the one that 
takes longer time in the unit-test but has a smaller memory footprint. 
 
If, for example, you want to find out whether it is advantageous to roll out a big loop then 
you cannot rely on a unit-test without taking cache effects into account. 
 
You can calculate how much memory a function uses by looking at a link map or an 
assembly listing. Use the "generate map file" option for the linker. Both code cache use and 
data cache use can be critical. The branch target buffer is also a cache that can be critical. 
Therefore, the number of jumps, calls and branches in a function should also be considered. 
 
A realistic performance test should include not only a single function or hot spot but also the 
innermost loop that includes the critical functions and hot spots. The test should be 
performed with a realistic set of data in order to get reliable results for branch 
mispredictions. The performance measurement should not include any part of the program 
that waits for user input. The time used for file input and output should be measured 
separately. 
 
The fallacy of measuring performance by unit-testing is unfortunately very common. Even 
some of the best optimized function libraries available use excessive loop unrolling so that 
the memory footprint is unreasonably large. 
 
16.3 Worst-case testing 
Most performance tests are done under the best-case conditions. All disturbing influences 
are removed, all resources are sufficient, and the caching conditions are optimal. Best-case 
testing is useful because it gives more reliable and reproducible results. If you want to 
compare the performance of two different implementations of the same algorithm, then you 
need to remove all disturbing influences in order to make the measurements as accurate 
and reproducible as possible. 
 
However, there are cases where it is more relevant to test the performance under the worst-
case conditions. For example, if you want to make sure that the response time to user input 
never exceeds an acceptable limit, then you should test the response time under worst-case 
conditions. 
 
Programs that produce streaming audio or video should also be tested under worst-case 
conditions in order to make sure that they always keep up with the expected real-time 
speed. Delays or glitches in the output are unacceptable. 
 
Each of the following methods could possibly be relevant when testing worst-case 
performance: 
 
 
The first time you activate a particular part of the program, it is likely to be slower 
than the subsequent times because of lazy loading of the code, cache misses and 
branch mispredictions. 
   
 
Test the whole software package, including all runtime libraries and frameworks, 
rather than isolating a single function. Switch between different parts of the software 
package in order to increase the likelihood that certain parts of the program code are 
uncached or even swapped to disk. 
   
 
Software that relies on network resources and servers should be tested on a network 
with heavy traffic and a server in full use rather than a dedicated test server.

 
Use large data files and databases with lots of data. 
   
 
Use an old computer with a slow CPU, an insufficient amount of RAM, a lot of 
irrelevant software installed, a lot of background processes running, and a slow and 
fragmented hard disk. 
   
 
Test with different brands of CPUs, different types of graphics cards, etc. 
   
 
Use an antivirus program that scans all files on access. 
   
 
Run multiple processes or threads simultaneously. If the microprocessor has 
hyperthreading, then try to run two threads in the same processor core. 
   
 
Try to allocate more RAM than there is, in order to force the swapping of memory to 
disk. 
   
 
Provoke cache misses by making the code size or data used in the innermost loop 
bigger than the cache size. Alternatively, you may actively invalidate the cache. The 
operating system may have a function for this purpose, or you may use the 
_mm_clflush intrinsic function. 
   
 
Provoke branch mispredictions by making the data more random than normal.
